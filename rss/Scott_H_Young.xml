It takes enormous work to bring your worldview even partly in line with what experts think. Deep understanding requires you to review much of the knowledge that experts possess—hardly a task for the intellectually lazy. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17047" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> Instead, it&#39;s typically the reflexive contrarians who are intellectually lazy. They would prefer to read one flashy book that supports a worldview they are already predisposed to believe rather than wade through multiple dense textbooks that slowly build the consensus perspective.</p><p> Simply parroting the conclusions of experts is not enough. To really understand an expert conclusion, you need to develop for yourself the mental models used to generate it. That&#39;s hard work. It&#39;s why getting an advanced degree in a field takes so long—mastering the tools and models needed to accurately simulate the expert opinion in a wide range of scenarios within a single field takes years, and that must happen before the student can do their own meaningful work in that field.</p><p> Truly smart contrarianism not only has to articulate an opposing view, but provide a deep explanation for why that viewpoint is not widely accepted by other smart people with similar knowledge. Few experts in a given field ever reach this position, never mind casual readers commenting on a topic outside of their specialty.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Final, Moderating Factors</h2><p> My original advice was:</p><p> <strong>If you want to have more true beliefs, you should simply believe the experts who study the topic, most of the time.</strong></p><p> I would add a few moderating factors to that generalization:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Experts can tell you what to believe—not how strongly to believe it.</h3><p> The quality of evidence used to form expert beliefs varies widely. Despite this, experts, on the whole, are highly confident of their own opinions. Since making decisions in life depends on not only what the “best guess” beliefs are, but how likely they are to be correct, this lack of calibration is a problem for my simple model of trusting experts. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17048" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> I have much more faith in basic physics than basic nutrition, for instance. I would be extremely surprised if the principles of quantum mechanics turned out to be wrong, but it wouldn&#39;t shock me if nutritional researchers flip-flopped on the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/">link between saturated fat and heart disease</a> .</p><p> This lack of confidence calibration means that while it&#39;s not usually justified to say, “the experts are all wrong, you should believe X instead,” it&#39;s not always incorrect to say, “the experts are wrong, you shouldn&#39;t have <em>any</em> opinion on X.” Skepticism of the expert view in shaky fields is consistent with the position I&#39;m advocating for, even if true skepticism (rather than ardent belief in even more dubious propositions) is quite rare.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. If your goal isn&#39;t to maximize true beliefs, contrarianism can be justified.</h3><p> Somewhat ironically, the individual experts aren&#39;t necessarily incentivized to maximize the truth value of their beliefs. Expert consensus is a kind of smudgy, bland version of a particular worldview; it&#39;s what&#39;s left after averaging out of all sorts of unique or unusual perspectives. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17049" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> In contrast, a scientist or pundit aims not just to be right about the stuff everyone already agrees on, but to be <em>surprisingly</em> correct—to hold a belief that later turns out to be perceived as more plausible, thus changing the consensus viewpoint.</p><p> Indeed, this may even be a good thing. An intellectual environment where all experts followed my “just trust the experts” maxim would result in excessive conformity of opinion, making bias more likely. We should want to live in a world where experts don&#39;t agree, and instead debate each other, as this raises the average quality of their opinions.<span id='easy-footnote-4-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-17038' title="There is certainly a tension here with my advice. I recognize the value of believing experts, and I also recognize that if this is all I do, my work will probably fail to have much lasting intellectual value. I need to adopt at least a mild degree of contrarianism in my work, or I’ll risk being irrelevant."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p><p> An analogy is investing. The average investor is better off putting their money in a low-cost index fund rather than picking stocks. Most investors (including professionals) fail to beat the market consistently. And yet, we do want at least some amount of (mostly deluded) contrarians trying to actively beat the market, since it is this very activity that determines values in the market.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最后的想法</h2><p>While I first heard this argument for believing expertise ages ago, I don&#39;t think its logic alone is what made me attempt to follow it more rigorously in my life.</p><p> Instead, it&#39;s the experience of having been persuaded by a contrarian expert, being fully convinced and, years later, being dissuaded from those original views as I encountered more evidence. And unlike the boy who touched the fire, it took being burned more than a few times before I developed the reflex.</p><p> While I doubt this argument will bring any dyed-in-the-wool contrarians or conspiracy theorists to my worldview, I do hope it will nudge a few people into giving more weight to the dominant expert perspective, and a bit less weight to the voices of persuasive-sounding contrarians.</p><p> Because, ultimately, having true beliefs does matter. Your beliefs inform how you invest, eat, build your career, raise your kids and take care of your health. And if your fundamental worldview isn&#39;t optimized for gathering true beliefs, you&#39;re bound to make mistakes.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/">Just Trust the Experts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reading – Day One Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=17026 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m just beginning the fifth month of my year-long Foundations project.

It&#39;s also one that people do less frequently than they used to: most adults read fewer books than they did in decades past, no doubt a trend caused by the rise of smartphones.</p><p> However, reading books is something I&#39;m fairly good at. I&#39;ve regularly read at least 10 books for each month of this project so far, typically including at least two college-level textbooks for each topic. While my reading volume tends to go up and down depending on my projects, I can easily read a hundred books in a year when such reading is central to my work. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17029" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> Therefore, my personal goals for the month will be a little different than the habit I&#39;m encouraging other people to build this month, which is to always have a book. I&#39;ll touch on this general recommendation more at the end of this post, but otherwise I&#39;m focusing here on what I&#39;m doing in the month ahead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Two Goals: Bedtime Reading and Increased Breadth</h2><p> I have two goals for this month. The first is to get into a regular habit of reading before going to sleep. I do this sometimes, but not consistently. My hope here isn&#39;t to increase my reading volume, rather I want to use the habit to encourage better (and earlier) sleep.</p><p> I&#39;m not setting a minimum threshold for bedtime reading, since that would quickly become a burden if I stay up later than usual owing to social events. But I think having the habit of reading before sleep, even if only for a minute, will encourage me to wind down faster than looking at a screen.</p><p> My second goal for the month is to spend more time reading books outside of my usual non-fiction focus. While I enjoy literature and off-topic non-fiction books, they definitely take a back seat when I&#39;m working on a research project. I probably won&#39;t be able to sustain this breadth as I shift to future months, but I will use this month to plan some longer-term reading lists in areas I read less than I&#39;d like.</p><p> Here are some of the categories of books I&#39;d like to read more of:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Classic literature.</strong> Ever since reading Hirsch&#39;s book arguing for cultural literacy, I&#39;ve been encouraged to expand my reading with more classic works of fiction.</li><li> <strong>Religious works.</strong> I&#39;m not religious, but I think religion is a topic worth reading more of both for its cultural significance and its lessons for everyday life.</li><li><strong>历史。</strong> I&#39;ve read quite a few biographies, often while researching for my books, but I&#39;m less well-informed about a lot of history on its own. Given that history knowledge tends to be voluminous, I&#39;d like to make some efforts to expand here.</li><li> <strong>Books in other languages.</strong> I don&#39;t do nearly as much conversation practice in other languages as I used to; it was one of the necessary sacrifices I made to save time when I became a parent. But reading more in the languages I want to maintain is easier to fit in and something I&#39;d like to cultivate.</li></ol><p> I already have some books in each of these topics, probably more than enough for the month ahead, but I&#39;ll use this month to prepare some longer-term lists, so I&#39;ll have more books to choose from when those initial ideas run out.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> AHAB: Always Have A Book</h2><p> The keystone habit I&#39;m encouraging people in my <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> to cultivate for this month is simpler than my personal goals. It comes from the observation that a major obstacle to reading more is simply not having anything you&#39;re excited to read <em>right now</em> .</p><p> The practice to solve this can be summarized in a simple acronym AHAB, or “Always Have A Book.”</p><p> The goal is to have a book you&#39;re interested in reading with you at all times. This doesn&#39;t mean you need to lug around large paperbacks with you everywhere you go. With Kindle and Audible apps, you can now keep an entire library on your smartphone.</p><p> Setting this up means getting quite a few books—either buying them or borrowing them from a local library.</p><p> It also means prioritizing books you&#39;re keenly interested in reading. A common mistake people trying to read more make is trying to finish whatever boring book they&#39;ve already started. Then, because they don&#39;t actually want to read it, they spend more time on social media.</p><p> If you&#39;re already a voluminous reader, you can challenge yourself with harder books. But if you don&#39;t regularly read at least one book per month, I encourage you to build a habit of picking books you enjoy and not feeling even a twinge of guilt about failing to finish any book that no longer interests you.</p><p> I&#39;ve long practiced the AHAB habit, but even I slip occasionally. I&#39;ll have periods where I have a few paper books, but no Kindle books—which means I check the news on my phone rather than read. Or I don&#39;t have an audiobook I&#39;m listening to—which means I can&#39;t listen to anything other than music or podcasts even if I want to listen to a book.</p><p> Therefore, as part of my own challenge, I&#39;m aggressively stocking all of my go-to book places, so I have plenty of books ready at my office, nightstand, Kindle app and Audible.</p><p> As an aside, I&#39;m also hoping to use this month to relax a little bit in the project. The start of the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> , plus the research-heavy <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">food</a> and <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/">money</a> months, made my workload a little high over the previous two months. Since I&#39;ve spent the last several years of my life reading books about learning, my reading-about-reading book list will probably be a little lighter this month, and I&#39;ll use that downtime to read or listen to more off-topic books.</p><p> As always, I&#39;ll share how this focus went for me at the end of the month, as well as some of the books I enjoyed.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/">Reading – Day One Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Food – Month-End Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=17013 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m wrapping up the fourth month in my year-long foundations project.

Although I read a lot more and deepened my knowledge of many of the aspects of nutrition I was unclear on, behaviorally speaking, I was already pretty happy with my eating habits when this month began. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17015" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> My focus for the month, then, was on tracking my food intake. In particular, I was curious to see how my actual eating habits conformed to both dietary guidelines and my own subjective sense of how healthy I have been eating.</p><p> As an experiment, I found tracking my food intake for the month to be informative. In terms of nutritional information, I learned:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>I almost always get more than the minimum recommendation for fiber.</strong></li><li> <strong>I&#39;m typically under the threshold for saturated fat.</strong></li><li> <strong>I consume more sodium than I should.</strong> I&#39;m typically over, and this may be an undercount as my tracking might have missed some added salt in home-cooked dishes.</li><li> <strong>My protein intake is above the DRIs, but can be lower</strong> than what is considered optimal for strength training if I&#39;m not intentional about including it in every meal.</li></ol><p> I would have liked to learn more about micronutrients in my diet, but the software I used couldn&#39;t track these well. Too few foods reliably list things like omega-3 or other micronutrient content to really know whether my diet, which abstains from red meat, is low on zinc or iron, for instance.</p><p> In addition to nutritional information, I also got a lot of behavioral data:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> I tended to overconsume food when eating at restaurants or having guests over and cooking large dinners. When I cooked my own food and ate with my family, eating moderate portion sizes was pretty easy to do.</li><li> I don&#39;t drink often, but drinks caught me off guard for empty calories.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some of My Early Results</h2><p> Of course, most people don&#39;t track food intake to gain insight; they track to lose weight. I wasn&#39;t aiming to lose a lot of weight this month, but the app I used (MacroTracker) required it to set up the goals. Despite my ambivalence about sticking to the calories it recommended, I did end up adhering most of the time and lost about 4 lbs. from the start of the month.</p><p> While I mostly credit the fitness and dietary changes I started four months ago, rather than the specific efforts of this month, I&#39;m quite happy with my progress in my overall body composition. I&#39;m now around 165 lbs., down from a peak of around 178 lbs. shortly before the project started.</p><p> I haven&#39;t been consistent in measuring my waistline, but that has shifted too: it started around 37” sometime during the first month of the project and is around 33” now. Given I&#39;m in the “healthy” BMI range, I&#39;m going to pay more attention to this metric over the long-term, since muscle gains and losses will blur any effect of weight loss <em>per se</em> .</p><p> It&#39;s nice to be a bit leaner, closer to my college-era weight than I have been for the last several years, but I&#39;m also doing my best to not fixate on it. I&#39;m chastened by the pessimistic data on weight regain, so I&#39;d rather focus on sustaining health and fitness over the long-term.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why I&#39;m Not Tracking Long-Term</h2><p> While my experiment with tracking food was informative, it&#39;s not a behavior I want to sustain in the future. Tracking was annoying in the beginning, but now it&#39;s fairly well-automated as a habit, so I don&#39;t find the act of tracking to be the main problem. Instead, I think tracking what I ate had a few unwanted side effects that distracted me from how I&#39;d really like to eat:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Tracking encourages you to eat easy-to-track foods rather than healthy foods.</strong> While tracking discourages some poor food choices, such as junk food with a lot of calories, I find it also subtly encourages eating foods with nutritional labels, which ends up increasing processed foods rather than whole foods.</li><li> <strong>Tracking encourages a focus on calories (or macros) rather than other aspects of nutritional quality.</strong> This could be a side-effect of the app I was using, but I found that gamifying things like calorie count or grams of protein/fat/carbs encourages you to use that lens for viewing nutrition—but this approach wasn&#39;t really supported by my overall research. Such an emphasis encourages you to see whole wheat bread and white bread as being basically the same nutritionally, when they&#39;re really worlds apart.</li><li> <strong>Tracking encourages paying attention to numbers rather than internal sensations.</strong> The month of tracking gave me renewed appreciation for the more mindful way of eating I had been following the previous three months. When you focus on calories, you eat more when you have “room” and you hold back, even though you&#39;re hungry, when you&#39;re over. This may be good if you&#39;re struggling with overeating, but I found it discouraged me from listening to my own sensations of hunger and satiety, instead taking the app for ground truth.</li></ol><p> While the research on tracking tends to be fairly positive in terms of its overall effectiveness, for the sake of my diet long-term, I&#39;m going to focus on generally eating high nutritional quality food, being as physically active as possible and being mindful that I&#39;m eating enough—not too much or too little.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Food, Beyond Nutrition</h2><p> I&#39;m leaving this month feeling good about how I eat. One disappointment from the month was that the act of tracking preoccupied more of my time than anticipated, so I feel like the month ended up being more about <em>nutrition</em> (and less about other aspects of food) than I had initially intended. I had wanted to also focus on cooking more, exploring new recipes and finding more ways to make healthier eating more satisfying on a regular basis.</p><p> Now that I&#39;m taking a pause on tracking, I think I&#39;ll be able to resume some of these other aspirations, and I&#39;ll certainly get to revisit them when this essay gets published and I&#39;m working on this foundation along with everyone in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> .</p><p> Overall, I&#39;m satisfied with how this month went. I gained some insight into my eating habits, recommitted myself to the changes I started four months ago, and even managed to lose a few pounds.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Update on Fitness, Productivity and Money</h2><p> Some quick updates on my continued progress in the previous three foundations I covered:</p><p> For fitness, I continued to make major strides. I did two long runs of 21km, a half-marathon distance, and by far my longest runs ever. I can now do 9 pull-ups in a row, compared to 3 when I started. I&#39;m still below my peak strength on major lifts, but I&#39;m inching closer.</p><p> For productivity, I can&#39;t say that much has changed. I&#39;m better at tracking and coordinating a lot of non-work related tasks with my wife, but time is still limited, and staying on top of low-priority chores is still hard. I&#39;m accepting that there will always be more to do than time to do it in, and trying to feel good about what I am able to accomplish.</p><p> For money, I&#39;m actually a little behind with my monthly expense tracking. This was largely a side-effect of creating a new tracking template and thus needing to go through and relabel the past year of transactions before moving forward. Given I&#39;ve been tracking my expenses for nearly two decades already, I&#39;m not too concerned, but I&#39;m hoping to get caught up.</p><p> This month was also incredibly busy. Because I write these updates three months before we cover each topic in the class and they are published here, this was also (for me) the first month of the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> with the new students. I love teaching, but it definitely adds to my workload compared to just doing a solitary project. Additionally, my wife broke her foot which forced a reorganization of many of our day-to-day habits and childcare tasks.</p><p> Next month&#39;s focus will be on reading, a foundation I&#39;m already quite content with, so I&#39;m hoping it will act as a little bit of a breather on my end.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/">Food – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Four: How Life of Focus Works</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 25 Jan 2025 16:19:30 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16925 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> On Monday, Cal Newport and I are reopening Life of Focus for a new session.

Before we do that, I&#39;d like to take this chance to explain how Life of Focus works—since it is a little different from what most people have come to expect from online courses—and share how I think about designing courses to encourage behavior change.</p><p> The classic course is all about providing information. There&#39;s a syllabus with a list of content; a bunch of lectures where the ideas, facts and concepts are conveyed; and finally, there&#39;s an exam to test if you remember everything you were taught.</p><p> There&#39;s nothing wrong with this model for many subjects. In many fields, information is what&#39;s missing, so taking some time to learn is the best action.</p><p> However, from nearly two decades developing online courses, I&#39;ve often been disappointed with how the classic approach to structuring a course translates to action. The problem is that a lot of information, on its own, rarely translates to concrete behavioral change. A course on nutrition, for instance, will give you tons of useful concepts and ideas about eating better—but it may not actually change how you eat, which is the ultimate goal of most people.</p><p> When Cal Newport and I started designing Life of Focus, we knew this was going to be a potential issue in our course. Cal had recently published <em>Deep Work</em> and <em>Digital Minimalism</em> . Most of our prospective students had either read these books or followed Cal&#39;s blog or podcast and were already familiar with his calls for increasing focus in work and life.</p><p> We knew that people attending the course didn&#39;t need more exhortations to turn off their email when doing deep work or lessons about the neuroscience of attentional processing. Instead, we designed the course to guide them through specific steps to create new working behaviors, and to have follow-through so those behaviors could become lifelong habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Format of an Action-Centered Course</h2><p> As a result of this, Life of Focus (and my more recent course, Foundations) follows a different model than what we typically think of as a course.</p><p> To start, the course is organized into three monthly challenges. Rather than putting the lessons first with the homework as an optional bonus (let&#39;s face it, most people who take online courses rarely do the assignments), we put taking action to improve our focus first, and then provide regular lessons to remind and reinforce those actions as they are already underway.</p><p> The three challenges for Life of Focus are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Tracking your deep work hours</strong></li><li> <strong>Conducting a digital declutter, and</strong></li><li> <strong>Engaging in a focus-building project to make or learn something new.</strong></li></ul><p> As another inversion to the typical course format, we start each month with a guided worksheet. This helps students come up with step-by-step actions they can take to begin each month-long challenge with the best footing. Only once students start working on the challenge do we start providing lessons to fine-tune, remind, motivate and redirect students as they go through the month.</p><p> On top of this, we add a lot of direct community support and coaching so students can quickly address sticking points as they come up, before they fall off the challenge or get discouraged.</p><p> In brief, the format of Life of Focus is more like a personal trainer at the gym than a university class on exercise science. By encouraging action from the get-go, the lessons and feedback support behavioral changes as you&#39;re making them.</p><p> While Cal and I were unsure how such a novel course format would work with students, we have been pleasantly surprised, and many students have told us Life of Focus is their favorite course they&#39;ve taken with us. Many students have even taken the course multiple times since they first enrolled, treating second and third passes as a chance to further refine their process using the three-month structure it provides.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Life of Focus Opens Monday</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16945" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-768x415.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div><p> I wanted to explain this course format because, in running this course and others over the last few years, I&#39;ve forgotten how different this approach can be for many people.

And in the years since I&#39;ve started writing, it has gotten harder.</p><p> Diagnoses of ADHD (including self-diagnoses) have skyrocketed. While it&#39;s likely that some of this is due to a lessening of stigma around mental health issues revealing what was already there, anecdotally, it appears that people are having a much harder time concentrating than they used to.</p><p> The number of people I know who struggle to finish reading a single book, or who can&#39;t seem to stay on task for more than twenty minutes without opening their email, seems to be getting worse.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Are Smartphones Ruining Our Brains?</h2><p> While technology certainly plays a role in our collective distractibility, it&#39;s probably not the case that Google is literally making us stupider, or that we&#39;ve lost the ability to focus. I agree with cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham, who raises his eyebrows at the idea that our fundamental brain architecture could be reshaped in this way.</p><p> Instead, there&#39;s a much simpler explanation for why focus is hard—and why it has gotten harder. In short, the ability to sustain attention on something is a function of two factors:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>拉</strong>。<strong> </strong>This is how much an activity draws in and motivates us to sustain our attention. True multitasking is a myth, and our attention can only focus on one thing at a time. As a result, the pull of an activity is always defined <em>relative to everything else we could possibly be paying attention to at this moment.</em></li><li> <strong>Friction</strong> .<strong> </strong>This is how much resistance, difficulty or effort is required to sustain engagement in an activity. Too much friction, and even something that should be compelling is pushed out for easier alternatives. </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16936" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> These two factors help to explain why focusing has gotten so difficult lately. We&#39;re now in an environment where strong pulls on our attention are ubiquitous, so the relative pull for reading a great book is simply too quiet compared to the pull of social media or streaming television.</p><p> Second, many of our most potent distractions have become increasingly frictionless. When I started blogging two decades ago, reading my feeds meant going to the room with my computer (I still had a desktop), turning it on (which took forever), connecting to the internet, opening my RSS feed reader, and scrolling through an uncurated list of simple headlines to decide what to read.</p><p> Had I been born two decades later, I&#39;d instead have TikTok, which only requires taking a device out of my pocket, with whatever content *it* deems most interesting served up to me instantaneously.</p><p> “Dumb” media and old-fashioned hobbies, which haven&#39;t altered much, have the same pull and friction that they&#39;ve always had. But they can&#39;t compete with the attentional candy we now encounter regularly.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How to Improve Your Ability to Focus</h2><p> This two-part model of focus suggests a simple answer for how you can focus better: increase the relative pull of an activity, reduce the friction, or both. And since pull and friction are defined relative to all salient alternatives, you can achieve the same impact by reducing the pull or increasing the friction of your most tempting distractions.</p><p> Let&#39;s consider all four possibilities:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Increase the pull of focusing</strong> . Read more interesting books. Choose hobbies you find compelling. Join groups to integrate socializing with activities you enjoy. Measure your progress and give yourself rewards just for showing up.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the friction of focusing</strong> . Have books always available. Have your hobbies “ready-to-go” rather than requiring lengthy setup. Stop reading books that bore you (read something else instead). Make it possible to quickly dip into the things you care about.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the pull of distractions</strong> . Put your phone on grayscale. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">Switch your media consumption to RSS feeds</a> , rather than algorithmically curated sources.</li><li> <strong>Increase the friction of distractions</strong> . Keep your phone in a dedicated location in your house, rather than at your hip. Delete apps from your phone, so you need to log in with your computer.</li></ol><p> A similar fourfold list of strategies can be employed for improving your focused work, not just your focused leisure: Increase the pull of deep work, decrease the pull of shallow work, decrease the friction of deep work, increase the friction of shallow work.</p><p> Shifting to a more focused life takes time and work. None of these changes are automatic, and it can take awhile for them to feel natural. But if you invest in a more focused life now, you can reap dividends for all your years to come. With sufficient time, these habits will become automatic and, sure enough, you&#39;ll find yourself reading more books, engaging in more interesting hobbies and completing more meaningful projects.</p><p> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my course co-taught with Cal Newport, will begin on Monday, January 27th. If you&#39;re interested in joining, I will be sending out registration information on Monday. I look forward to working with a dedicated group of students to help them improve their focus and achieve bigger things in 2025!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/">Lesson Three: Why You Can&#39;t Focus</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Two: More Craft, Less Chores</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:18:53 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16921 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;ve always struggled with the idea of work-life balance.

What counts as “work” and what counts as “leisure” is harder to separate when I make my own schedule and don&#39;t get paid by the hour. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16933" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> For instance, when I read a book that really interests me and then write about it later—was the reading work or fun? What if I had to read the book for research? What&#39;s different between the drawings I do for fun and those I use on this blog?</p><p> Perhaps I&#39;m an isolated case, but I&#39;d like to think not. In the years Cal Newport and I have run <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , I&#39;ve interacted with dozens of students who struggle with work and play being intermixed in both their time at home and their time formally allocated to an employer.</p><p> The situation is even more complicated for retirees, students, academics, and stay-at-home parents, many of whom aren&#39;t “paid,” strictly speaking, for many things that clearly seem to be work.</p><p> Recently, however, I&#39;ve stumbled into a distinction I think matters more than the one between work and life: that between craft and chores. While work seemingly embodies everything you must do to earn a living, and life is everything else, craft is all of the productive activities that utilize your creativity and skill in order to accomplish something you&#39;re proud of, and chores are all the tasks that must be done to keep on going but don&#39;t satisfy this same desire.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Maximize Craft Instead of Balancing Work</h2><p> One thing I like about this revised approach is that it shifts the goals for our productive lives.</p><p> Working nonstop is not desirable. Burnout is real, and even if you love your job, pressure to perform continuously can be exhausting. If you add to that all the commitments you have outside of work, even a dream job can become a millstone around your neck if you aren&#39;t careful.</p><p> Yet “balance” is definitionally hard to achieve.</p><p> Balance is akin to Aristotle&#39;s maxim that virtue is to be found in moderation—except everyone&#39;s definition of moderation is different. What&#39;s a moderate amount of eating?喝？ Going to the office? We end up falling back on cultural norms, where 9 to 5 is considered “balanced” even though a full-time job can be exhausting if you also have full-time childcare duties. And different cultures may have entirely different standards, in fact China&#39;s infamous 9-9-6 start-up culture was sold as being *more* balanced than the nonstop-work ethic promoted at more aggressive firms.</p><p> In general, it&#39;s easier to optimize a dimension of life by maximizing for something than by balancing between two extremes.</p><p> Given this, I prefer the idea of maximizing craft and minimizing chores across *both* my working life and personal life. I&#39;d like to write more essays and spend less time filing taxes in my work, just as I&#39;d like to finish more paintings and spend less time doing dishes at home. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16934" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Do You Maximize Craft?</h2><p> Definitions are nice, but how do you actually do this? Clearly, there will always be unavoidable chores both at work and at home. Spending more time on craft, while nice-sounding, can be hard to achieve in practice.</p><p> I believe the answer comes down to focus. In your work, if you can carve out regular chunks of time for deep work, you&#39;ll start automatically shifting your work toward the dimension of “craft” and away from “chores.” In the beginning, that shift might come from simply being more efficient with the chores, even if their quantity hasn&#39;t diminished. But, eventually, as you build “craft” accomplishments, it becomes easier to delegate and avoid chores in favor of more time spent on your craft.</p><p> We tend to specialize at what we regularly do, and if you spend your time on deep work, it creates a gravitational pull towards more deep work. Likewise, getting really good at chores makes you the person who gets assigned more chores.</p><p> At home, things are not quite as simple. Short of hiring an army of help, many chores will need to be done. But here, too, steps to maximize craft often succeed by squeezing out the hours spent on activities that are neither necessary chores nor meaningful crafts—the filler time spent endlessly scrolling on our phones or watching television shows we don&#39;t even enjoy.</p><p> In the previous lesson, I argued that this year should be a year for doing something big—actually finishing a project you&#39;ve had in mind for some time. Now, I&#39;d like to encourage you to go further, to think about maximizing the feeling of craft throughout your life. Doing activities that require full engagement, genuine skill and give you a feeling of satisfaction when they&#39;re completed.</p><p> In the next lesson, I&#39;ll share a simple model for how to think about focus. In particular, what you can do to overcome some of your own internal resistance to maximizing craft and achieving big things. And on Monday, January 27th, I&#39;ll reopen <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my three-month course co-taught by Cal Newport.敬请关注！</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/">Lesson Two: More Craft, Less Chores</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson One: Do Something Big This Year</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16919 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Cal Newport and I are opening our Life of Focus course for a new session next week.

At one end we have tasks, the myriad things that need doing in our day-to-day lives: filing taxes, walking the dog, doing laundry, submitting that report. At the other end are our grand dreams for our lives: to be financially independent, travel the world, build a business or raise successful kids.</p><p> Grand dreams are nice, but they&#39;re generally not very practical. It&#39;s easy to get excited as you think them over, but rarely does even the most compelling grand dream tell you what, precisely, you should be doing on Tuesday morning to make it come true. Their size and distance makes them poor objects for sustaining motivation.</p><p> Tasks and to-do lists suffer from the opposite problem. You can check off lots of tasks while accomplishing nothing major. Sure, the house is a little cleaner, maybe you&#39;ve balanced your chequebook and fixed the wobbly chair in the dining room, but these, like most tasks, simply sustain your current life. They don&#39;t take you somewhere new.</p><p> Projects act as the bridge between grand dreams and daily action. A big life goal often can be achieved in a project or two. And a project can be achieved through a coordinated series of tasks. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16931" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Mindset Needed to Habitually Complete Projects</h2><p> Being good at completing projects requires a different mindset than being merely productive (and thus being good at checking off tasks) or ambitious (and thus coming up with grand visions for your life).</p><p> Completing projects requires focus. Focus is not just the ability to sit down and work at something hard for hours at a time; it&#39;s also learning how to ignore all the other things screaming for your attention. Sometimes those other things are entertainment or distractions. More often, they&#39;re legitimate tasks and work that, if you heed their siren song, will have you crashing against the rocky shore of minutiae long before you reach your ambitious destination.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> It&#39;s Time to Finish What You Start</h2><p> My guess is that you already have some project ideas. Perhaps some you&#39;ve idly thought about. Perhaps some you&#39;ve already committed to. Perhaps some that oscillate between daydreams and serious efforts.</p><p> This year, I suggest you go ahead and finish one of them. It doesn&#39;t need to be the largest or most difficult project on your list—but it should be something that matters to you. Make this the year that you don&#39;t just *think* about doing it, but actually finish it.</p><p> Certainly, this is easier said than done. Perhaps you have dreamt up projects that have gone nowhere. Maybe you&#39;ve even insisted that “this time it&#39;s different,” and you&#39;re finally going to complete a project you&#39;ve been thinking about for years—only to succumb to the relentless tide of distractions in the months ahead.</p><p>我们都去过那里。</p><p> If you are looking for help with this, I encourage you to join the upcoming session of our course, Life of Focus. In it, we&#39;ll help you set and achieve a consistent deep work target—a necessity for making sustained progress. We&#39;ll declutter your leisure time—creating space to tackle big things. And we&#39;ll cultivate your ability to sustain your attention in the way, and on the things, you choose.</p><p> The full three-month course is a great complement to any big goal you&#39;ve been meaning to accomplish, but I want to leave you with one strategy you can apply today: right now, start tracking the hours you spend working on the project you have in mind.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t require fancy software or complicated calculations. A simple piece of paper where you tally every uninterrupted hour of work towards your project will suffice.</p><p> Put the tally on your wall, on your phone, or anywhere you will look at it often. By maintaining a visual reminder of your decision to focus, you can steadily move in the right direction.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p> <em><a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my three-month course co-taught with Cal Newport, will reopen for a new session on Monday, January 27, 2025.</em></p></blockquote><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/">Lesson One: Do Something Big This Year</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 14 Jan 2025 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16963 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Looking to eat better?

I decided to publish this one a little in advance because we’ll be holding a new session of Life of Focus in just over a week."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus is on food.</p><p> Part of my goal for each month is to read as much as I can about each topic, both for my own knowledge and to try to summarize the essential expert recommendations for those participating in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">course</a> .</p><p> Food is a particularly tricky subject. Nutritional science is complicated—and often conflicting. Popular media on this topic is a cesspool of misinformation, hype, and some downright dangerous advice being presented as the road to good health.</p><p> Still, I wanted to do my best to get it right. Given my complete lack of credentials in this area, that meant focusing my reading more on textbooks (I read two, each 800+ pages), popular books noted for their scientific accuracy (I read three specifically for their high ratings from the non-profit <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/">Red Pen Reviews</a> ), and those written by scholars I respect. I also made heavy use of the podcast <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/">Sigma Nutrition</a> , which presents academic discussions of nutritional research.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16963' title="I wouldn’t normally recommend a podcast in place of a scholarly reference source, but I found the detailed discussions of nutritional research to be much more nuanced than most other sources, including textbooks, I found elsewhere."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p> I can&#39;t say for sure that I got it all right. But after having read a few thousand pages and listened to many hours of scientific discussions, I suspect that much of the residual confusion I have is likely embedded in the field itself rather than a simple misunderstanding on my part.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The 3-Minute Summary of What I Learned (and Unlearned)</h2><p> In terms of concision, it&#39;s hard to beat Michael Pollan&#39;s overall eating advice:</p><p class="has-text-align-left"> <strong>“Eat food.不多。主要是植物。”</strong></p><p> Despite the complexity and contention of the underlying research, most advice for eating well is pretty basic: </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> Eat more whole foods.</li><li> Eat more fruits and vegetables.</li><li> Eat more fiber.</li><li> Eat a range of different food types and foods within each type.</li><li> Eat more whole grains.</li><li> Go easy on the refined grains, added sugars, processed meat and saturated fat.</li></ul></blockquote><p> A seventh recommendation, though not universally agreed to, might be “Try to eat a bit more protein, particularly from plant and marine sources.”</p><p> But, in addition to these fairly uncontroversial ideas, I also found some repeated ideas that surprised me somewhat:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Egg yolks aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Dietary cholesterol has a pretty minimal effect on blood cholesterol. Egg yolks famously have a lot of cholesterol, so they were unnecessarily vilified.</li><li> <strong>Too much saturated fat is still bad for you.</strong> Trans fats are worse, of course, but most sources recommend swapping solid fats in your diet, like lard and butter, for healthy oils to reduce the risk of heart disease.</li><li> <strong>Carbs aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Carbs have replaced fat as the dietary villain of our age, but carbs are the body&#39;s preferred energy source. Unrefined grains and carbs from fruit and vegetables are a boon for health.</li><li> <strong>Most additives in food are safe.</strong> Whole foods are good, of course, but the belief that small amounts of preservatives or chemical food additives are the source of ill health seems largely unfounded. Processing strips nutrients and reformulates foods to make them easier to overconsume, but the additives themselves are largely harmless.</li><li> <strong>Coffee and chocolate are healthy.</strong> In moderation, coffee appears to be a net positive for health. Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, seems to be good as well. Chocolate has a lot of calories, so it&#39;s easy to overconsume, but the type of saturated fat present in cacao isn&#39;t harmful.</li></ol><p> Despite this, there are still some controversies I couldn&#39;t find a straight answer on. It&#39;s still unclear to me whether whole milk or low-fat milk is better for health.<span id='easy-footnote-8-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-16963' title="Textbooks advocate for more milk consumption, but choosing low-fat varieties. Walter Willett advocates for less milk in general.

Given the difficulty of getting sodium intake to within dietary prescriptions, I wasn’t sure whether it was an area that needed improvement if I have normal blood pressure."><sup>9</sup></a></span> Obesity is also a major driver of diet-related illness, so it&#39;s not clear to me whether the recommended dietary interventions promote health by reducing your chances of gaining weight, or by being generally good for lean people.<span id='easy-footnote-10-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-16963' title="For instance, I encountered some research suggesting that even added sugars, the villain du jour of popular dietary advice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigmanutrition.com/episode468/&quot;>;may not actually be harmful&lt;/a>; if they don’t lead to caloric excess. In contrast, the prescription to avoid processed red meats seems to be related to the risk of colon cancer, independent of effects on weight. For other recommendations, this distinction was less clear."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Brief Notes on the 10 Books I Read</h2><p> My favorite book of the month was Walter Willett&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">Eat, Drink and Be Healthy</a> . Not only is it the most highly-rated book in terms of scientific accuracy and healthfulness on Red Pen Reviews, but Willett is the world&#39;s most-cited nutritional researcher.</p><p> The most engaging/fun read of the month was a re-read, Michael Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> . His high-level recommendations on eating are difficult to fault, and there is much to say in favor of his philosophy of common-sense nutrition. I disagree with Pollan on some research he cites, but I feel like you&#39;d hardly be led astray if you stick with his practical takeaways.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s look at some notes from each book:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</a> by Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16968" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Co-developed by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, this book is perhaps the most scientifically reputable, popular diet book available today. Willett, whose work on the Nurses&#39; Health Study made him one of the world&#39;s most-esteemed nutritional epidemiologists, provides his perspective on what science says we should eat to be healthy.</p><p> Most of the recommendations fit within the Mediterranean diet pattern—so-called because the famous Seven Countries Study found that inhabitants of Crete had much lower rates of heart disease, owing to their eating whole grains, lots of vegetables and seafood, little red meat and plenty of olive oil.</p><p> Despite its impeccable credentials, this book does depart in some ways from some of my other reading on nutrition. Willett continues to recommend moderate alcohol consumption for health, something that more recent data seem to be undermining.<span id='easy-footnote-11-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-16963' title="For clarification, it&amp;#8217;s long been known that excessive alcohol consumption is bad for you. But until recently, it was believed that moderate consumption (e.g., 1-2 glasses of wine per day) might have heart benefits that outweigh the cancer risks. More recent work, however, has failed to support this idea, finding that any alcohol consumption is bad for health."><sup>11</sup></a></span> Similarly, Willett argues for reducing milk consumption across the board, whereas both textbooks I read argue for making milk a regular part of the diet for its calcium and vitamin D and choosing low-fat options to avoid its saturated fat. Willett also advocates for a daily multivitamin, something other sources have questioned. Given the quality of the source, it&#39;s hard to say whether Willett or the textbook is correct on the issues where they diverge, so I chalk those areas up to uncertainty amongst qualified experts.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Weigh-Less-Delicious-ebook/dp/B00CKUEVT4/">Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less</a> by Mollie Katzen and Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16969" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> While the previous book is an excellent summary of the state of nutritional science, it&#39;s not a weight-loss book, and parsing it for weight-loss recommendations might take some effort. Fortunately, Katzen and Willett have translated the dietary recommendations into a specific plan for someone who wants both to eat healthier and lose weight.</p><p> The basic strategy of all weight-loss diets is caloric restriction. However, reducing calories increases the risk of missing out on essential nutrients, which is a particular risk of fad or crash diets. This book might be worthwhile if you want to lose some weight in as healthful a way as possible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Nutrition-MindTap-Course-List/dp/0357447514/">Understanding Nutrition</a> by Ellie Whitney and Sharon Rady Rolfes </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="848" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16970" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg 848w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_.jpg 1242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></figure></div><p> This was my favorite textbook. While the detailed explanations of the biochemistry of energy metabolism might be unnecessary for most people, I love explanations that go deeper into the science.</p><p> One thing I didn&#39;t know, for instance, was that many of the body&#39;s cells rely on glucose for energy, but the body cannot make glucose from fat (it can make glucose from protein). Fat burning proceeds during low-intensity daily activity, but most physical activity requires some glucose for performance. This was one of many warnings against extremely low-carb diets I read in the more “official” sources I read for the month.</p><p> Interestingly, although the style and specific content covered differed between the textbooks I read, the recommendations for health in both textbooks were practically identical. I suspect this is because both are drawing on the same original source, rather than the authors independently arriving at the same conclusion. It doesn&#39;t mean the advice is without controversy, but it was at least satisfying to note there does appear to be some nutritional orthodoxy that one can point to as being consistent.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Academy-Nutrition-Dietetics-Complete-Guide/dp/0544520580/">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Complete Food &amp; Nutrition Guide</a> by Roberta L.

I jokingly referred to it as “the phone book,” owing to its heft, as I lugged it between my home and office. Like a phone book, it was also far from the most exciting read. I can&#39;t fault the author here, as it&#39;s meant to be a reference book, so I don&#39;t believe anyone was expecting it to be read cover-to-cover. But, that was exactly what I did, and I&#39;m glad I made it through.</p><p> This book covers nearly any possible question you might have about food, ranging from the safety of artificial sweeteners to the proper handling of poultry, different types of eating disorders to the efficacy of sports supplements. Impossible to summarize, “the phone book” will sit on my shelf for any time I need to look up a particular nutritional question.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh/dp/B0BT733QD8/">Everything Fat Loss</a> by Ben Carpenter </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16972" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Weight loss, perhaps even more so than general nutrition advice, is rampant with false promises, inflated hype, dangerous diets and outright scams.</p><p> I found Carpenter&#39;s book after seeing that it received the second-highest rating on Red Pen Reviews, after Willett&#39;s book.<span id='easy-footnote-12-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-16963' title="The only fault ascribed to this book by the reviewers seems to be that Carpenter suggests dieting may be worse for your mental health than research suggests."><sup>12</sup></a></span> This book is like an encyclopedia of body composition strategies, evaluating everything from low-carb to low-fat, from intermittent fasting to weight maintenance.</p><p> While the book is useful for its specifics, the general message is pretty simple: weight loss occurs through a calorie deficit.

Worries about weight should take a back seat to eating enough to power performance.</li><li> <strong>Eat individually.</strong> Your diet must work for you, your culture and your tastebuds.</li></ol><p> Overall, I found a lot to like about Fitzgerald&#39;s book, although it&#39;s clearly aimed at avid runners, cyclists, swimmers and other athletes rather than the generally-sedentary population at large.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Power-Eating-Susan-Kleiner/dp/1492567264/">The New Power Eating</a> by Susan Kleiner with Maggie Greenwood-Robinson </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="717" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-717x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16976" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-717x1024.jpg 717w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-768x1096.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_.jpg 1051w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></figure></div><p> To round out the sports-centered nutrition books, I wanted to see how prescriptions vary for strength athletes, whose main goals are building muscle and power rather than aerobic fitness.</p><p> Fortunately, the recommendations are quite similar. Carbs are also important for strength training since glucose, not fat, can be broken down anaerobically in muscle tissues for the power needed for hard workouts, and hard workouts are needed to provide the muscles with appropriate stimulus to grow.</p><p> The main difference is that the authors of this book focused, somewhat predictably, on eating more protein than was recommended in the guidance for endurance athletes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> by Michael Pollan </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16977" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_.jpg 782w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this book years ago, after liking Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/">The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</a> . At its heart, I basically agree with Pollan&#39;s advice and overall philosophy: eat real food, eat more plants, eat in moderation, and focus on cooking good food rather than consuming ultra-processed junk.</p><p> However, after reading many other books, I feel some of Pollan&#39;s tirades miss the mark. He spends a lot of time writing about how the “lipid hypothesis” that nutritionists recommended for years has been debunked. But then he casually flips back and forth between correctly rejecting the idea that all fat is bad and presenting the false idea that nutritional science has decided that saturated fats aren&#39;t worth worrying about (the consensus is that they are).</p><p> Similarly, Pollan gives a lot of space to both Gary Taubes and T. Colin Campbell. Taubes&#39; insistence that sugar is the cause of the obesity epidemic (as opposed to excess calorie consumption, in general) is <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode429/">probably false</a> . Campbell&#39;s advocacy of a strict vegetarian diet, in turn, is probably based on <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">some shaky science</a> .</p><p> That said, Pollan articulates better than anyone else I read the philosophy of eating, not just to optimize nutrition, but for living better. That means cooking real food, using whole ingredients with less processing, and trusting more traditional diets rather than scientifically engineered concoctions.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
