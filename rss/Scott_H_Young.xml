href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">生活</a>。在我们这样做之前，我想借此机会解释焦点的生活如何工作，因为这与大多数人从在线课程中获得的期望有所不同，并分享我对设计课程的看法，以鼓励行为改变。</p><p>经典课程就是提供信息。有一个有内容列表的教学大纲；传达思想，事实和概念的一堆讲座；最后，有一项考试可以测试您是否记得所教的一切。</p><p>对于许多主题，这个模型没有错。在许多领域，信息是缺少的，因此花一些时间学习是最好的动作。</p><p>但是，从近二十年来开发在线课程中，我经常对构建课程的经典方法如何转化为行动感到失望。问题在于，许多信息本身很少转化为具体的行为改变。例如，关于营养的课程将为您提供许多有用的概念和更好的饮食概念，但实际上可能不会改变您的饮食方式，这是大多数人的最终目标。</p><p>当我和Cal Newport开始设计重点生活时，我们知道这将是我们课程的潜在问题。 Cal最近发表了<em>深入的工作</em>和<em>数字极简主义</em>。我们的大多数潜在学生要么阅读这些书，要么遵循Cal的博客或播客，并且已经熟悉他在工作和生活中越来越重点的呼吁。</p><p>我们知道，参加该课程的人们在进行深入工作或有关注意力处理的神经科学时就不需要更多的劝告来关闭电子邮件。取而代之的是，我们设计了该课程，以指导他们通过特定的步骤来创建新的工作行为，并具有跟进，以便这些行为可能成为终身习惯。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">以动作为中心的课程的格式</h2><p>因此，重点的生活（以及我最近的课程，基础）遵循的模型与我们通常认为的课程不同。</p><p>首先，该课程被组织成三个每月的挑战。我们没有将课程作为可选的奖励，而不是将在线课程很少完成作业的大多数人面对现实吧），而是采取行动以提高我们的焦点，然后提供常规的课程来提醒和加强这些动作已经在进行中。</p><p>重点生活的三个挑战是：</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>跟踪您的深入工作时间</strong></li><li><strong>进行数字整理，并</strong></li><li><strong>参与一个焦点建设项目，以制造或学习一些新的东西。</strong></li></ul><p>作为典型课程格式的另一种反转，我们每个月都从一个指导的工作表开始。这可以帮助学生提出他们可以采取的分步操作，以开始为期一个月的最佳挑战。只有一旦学生开始挑战，我们才能开始提供课程，以进行微调，提醒，激励和重定向学生。</p><p>最重要的是，我们添加了很多直接的社区支持和教练，以便学生可以在他们摆脱挑战或灰心之前迅速解决他们的注意点。</p><p>简而言之，重点生活的形式更像是体育馆的私人教练，而不是运动科学的大学课程。通过鼓励一开始的行动，课程和反馈支持行为改变。</p><p>尽管Cal和我不确定这种新颖的课程格式将如何与学生一起使用，但我们感到非常惊喜，许多学生告诉我们，聚焦生活是他们与我们一起学习的最喜欢的课程。自从他们首次入学以来，许多学生甚至多次参加了课程，将第二和第三次通过，是使用它提供的三个月结构进一步完善其过程的机会。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">焦点生活周一开放</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/"><img fetchpriority="high"

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>焦点很难。自从我开始写作以来的几年中，它变得越来越困难。</p><p>多动症（包括自我诊断）的诊断飙升。虽然其中一些可能是由于围绕心理健康问题的污名降低了，但揭示了已经存在的问题，但轶事，看来人们比以往的时间更加困难。</p><p>我认识的人数很难完成阅读一本书，或者似乎在没有打开电子邮件的情况下持续超过二十分钟的人，似乎越来越糟。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">智能手机会破坏我们的大脑吗？</h2><p>尽管技术肯定在我们的集体分辨率中发挥了作用，但Google实际上并不是让我们变得愚蠢，或者我们失去了专注的能力。我同意认知心理学家丹尼尔·威灵厄姆（Daniel Willingham）的观点，他对我们的基本脑建筑可以通过这种方式重塑的想法引起了人们的关注。</p><p>取而代之的是，对于为什么焦点很难，以及为什么它变得越来越困难，有一个简单的解释。简而言之，维持注意事物的能力是两个因素的函数：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>拉</strong>。<strong> </strong>这是一项活动吸引的程度并激励我们维持我们的注意力。真正的多任务是一个神话，我们的注意力只能一次关注一件事情。结果，活动的拉力始终是<em>相对于我们目前可能要关注的所有其他所有事物的定义。</em></li><li><strong>摩擦</strong>。<strong> </strong>这是维持参与活动所需的抵抗力，困难或努力。太多的摩擦，甚至应该引人注目的东西也被推出，以便于替代方案。 </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16936" style="width:450px"

/></figure></div><p>这两个因素有助于解释为什么聚焦最近变得如此困难。现在，我们正处于一个无处不在的环境中，与社交媒体或流媒体电视的吸引相比，阅读一本好书的相对吸引力太安静了。</p><p>其次，我们许多最有力的干扰已经变得越来越无摩擦。当我二十年前开始写博客时，阅读我的供稿意味着用我的计算机（我仍然有台式机）去房间，将其打开（永远花了），连接到互联网，打开我的RSS供稿阅读器，然后滚动。一个未经保修的简单标题列表，以决定要阅读的内容。</p><p>如果我出生了二十年后，我会拥有Tiktok，这只需要从我的口袋里取出设备，而任何内容 *它都认为最有趣的是瞬间地对我来说。</p><p> “愚蠢”的媒体和老式的爱好并没有发生太大变化，与他们一直都有相同的拉力和摩擦。但是他们无法与我们现在定期遇到的注意力糖果竞争。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">如何提高专注能力</h2><p>这两个部分的焦点模型为如何更好地集中精力提出了一个简单的答案：增加活动的相对拉力，减少摩擦或两者兼而有之。而且，由于拉力和摩擦是相对于所有显着替代方案定义的，因此您可以通过减少最诱人的干扰的摩擦或增加摩擦来实现相同的影响。</p><p>让我们考虑所有四种可能性：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>增加聚焦的吸引力</strong>。阅读更多有趣的书。选择您觉得引人注目的爱好。加入小组，将社交与您喜欢的活动融合在一起。衡量您的进度，并给自己奖励，只是为了露面。</li><li><strong>减少聚焦的摩擦</strong>。总是有书籍。让您的爱好“现成”，而不是需要冗长的设置。停止阅读让您感到无聊的书（而是阅读其他内容）。使您可以快速浸入您关心的事物。</li><li><strong>减少分心的吸引力</strong>。将手机放在灰度上。<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">将您的媒体消耗切换到RSS提要</a>，而不是算法策划的来源。</li><li><strong>增加分心的摩擦</strong>。将手机放在您家中专用的位置，而不是臀部。从手机删除应用程序，因此您需要使用计算机登录。</li></ol><p>可以采用类似的四倍策略来改善您的专注工作，而不仅仅是您的集中休闲：增加深度工作的吸引力，减少浅水工作的吸引力，减少深层工作的摩擦，增加浅水工作的摩擦。</p><p>转移到更加集中的生活需要时间和工作。这些变化都不是自动的，他们感到自然可能需要一段时间。但是，如果您现在投资于更加集中的生活，那么您可以在未来的所有几年中收获股息。有足够的时间，这些习惯将变得自动，果然，您会发现自己正在阅读更多书籍，从事更有趣的爱好并完成更有意义的项目。</p><p>我与CAL Newport的课程共同教授的<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life Life</a>将于1月27日星期一开始。如果您有兴趣加入，我将在周一发送注册信息。我期待与一群专门的学生合作，以帮助他们提高注意力并在2025年实现更大的目标！</p><p><a

href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">重点关注的</a>那几年中，我与数十名学生互动，他们在工作的时间和时间正式分配给雇主。</p><p>对于退休人员，学生，学者和全职父母而言，这种情况更加复杂，严格来说，其中许多人并不是“付款”，对于许多显然工作的事情而言。</p><p>但是，最近，我偶然发现了一个区别，我认为与工作与生活之间的杂物相比，这比工艺与杂务之间的重要性更重要。虽然工作似乎体现了您为谋生而要做的一切，而生活就是其他一切，但工艺是利用您的创造力和技巧来实现自己骄傲的事情的所有生产性活动，而琐事都是所有的任务必须继续前进，但不满足这种愿望。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最大化工艺而不是平衡工作</h2><p>我喜欢这种修订的方法的一件事是，它改变了我们富有成效的生活的目标。</p><p>不间断地工作是不可取的。倦怠是真实的，即使您热爱自己的工作，持续执行的压力也可能令人筋疲力尽。如果您添加工作以外的所有承诺，即使您不小心，即使是梦想中的工作也可能成为脖子上的磨石。</p><p>然而，“平衡”在定义上很难实现。</p><p>平衡类似于亚里士多德的格言，即适度地找到美德 - 除了每个人对节制的定义都不同。什么是适度的饮食？喝？去办公室？我们最终会依靠文化规范，其中9至5被认为是“平衡”的，即使如果您还承担了全职育儿职责，全职工作可能会累人。而且，不同的文化可能具有完全不同的标准，实际上，中国臭名昭著的9-9-6启动文化被出售为 *与在更具侵略性的公司中促进的不间断伦理相比， *更加平衡。</p><p>通常，通过最大化事物来优化生活的维度要比两个极端之间的平衡更容易。</p><p>鉴于此，我更喜欢最大限度地提高工艺和最大程度地减少 *我的工作生活和个人生活的琐事的想法。我想写更多的论文，花更少的时间在我的工作中提交税款，就像我想完成更多的绘画并花更少的时间在家做菜一样。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure

class="wp-block-heading">您如何最大化工艺？</h2><p>定义很好，但是您实际上是如何做到的？显然，在工作和家里，总会有不可避免的琐事。在实践中，花更多的时间在手工上，虽然听起来不错，但很难实现。</p><p>我相信答案是集中精力的。在您的工作中，如果您可以花很多时间进行深入工作的时间，那么您将开始自动将工作转移到“工艺”的维度，并远离“琐事”。一开始，这种转变可能是由于杂务的效率更加有效，即使它们的数量没有减少。但是，最终，随着您建立“手工艺”成就，更容易委派和避免琐事，而倾向于花更多的时间花在您的工艺上。</p><p>我们倾向于专注于我们经常做的事情，如果您花时间进行深入的工作，它会产生重力促进更深入的工作。同样，变得非常擅长琐事会使您成为分配更多琐事的人。</p><p>在家里，事情并不那么简单。缺少雇用一支帮助的军队，需要做许多琐事。但是，在这里，在这里也经常通过挤出既不是必要的琐事也不有意义的手工艺的活动的时间来实现最大化工艺的步骤，这是花费的时间无休止地滚动在我们的电话上或看电视节目，甚至我们都不喜欢。</p><p>在上一堂课中，我认为今年应该是做大事的一年

class="wp-block-heading">我学到的东西的3分钟摘要（未经学习）</h2><p>在简洁方面，很难击败迈克尔·波兰（Michael Pollan）的整体饮食建议：</p><p class="has-text-align-left"> <strong>“吃食物。不多。主要是植物。”</strong></p><p>尽管基础研究的复杂性和争执，但大多数饮食良好的建议还是很基本的： </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>多吃全食。</li><li>多吃水果和蔬菜。</li><li>多吃纤维。</li><li>每种类型的食物和食物都多样化。</li><li>多吃全谷物。</li><li>在精制的谷物，添加的糖，加工的肉和饱和脂肪上轻松放松。</li></ul></blockquote><p>第七个建议虽然不是普遍同意的，但可能是“尝试吃更多的蛋白质，尤其是植物和海洋来源。”</p><p>但是，除了这些相当无争议的想法外，我还发现了一些重复的想法，使我有些惊讶：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>蛋黄对你还不错。</strong>饮食胆固醇对血液胆固醇的影响很小。蛋黄是著名的胆固醇，因此不必要地遭受了侵害。</li><li><strong>太多的饱和脂肪仍然对您不利。</strong>当然，反式脂肪更糟，但是大多数消息来源建议将饮食中的固体脂肪（如猪油和黄油）换成健康油，以降低心脏病的风险。</li><li><strong>碳水化合物对您不利。</strong>碳水化合物已取代脂肪为我们这个时代的饮食反派，但碳水化合物是人体首选的能源。水果和蔬菜的未精制谷物和碳水化合物是健康的福音。</li><li><strong>食物中的大多数添加剂都是安全的。</strong>当然，全食物是好的，但是相信少量的防腐剂或化学食品添加剂是健康状况不佳的来源。加工养分并重新植入食品，使其更容易过度征服，但是添加剂本身在很大程度上是无害的。</li><li><strong>咖啡和巧克力很健康。</strong>适度地，咖啡似乎是健康的净阳性。巧克力，尤其是黑巧克力，似乎也很好。巧克力有很多卡路里，因此很容易过度解决问题，但是可可中存在的饱和脂肪类型并不有害。</li></ol><p>尽管如此，我仍然有一些争议我找不到直接的答案。我仍然不清楚全牛奶还是低脂牛奶更适合健康。<span

class="wp-block-heading">关于我读的10本书的简短笔记</h2><p>我本月最喜欢的书是沃尔特·威利特（Walter Willett）的<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">饮食，喝酒和健康</a>。就红笔评论而言，它不仅是科学准确性和健康性的最高书籍，而且威利特（Willett）是世界上最引用的营养研究人员。</p><p>本月最吸引人/最有趣的是迈克尔·波兰（Michael Pollan）<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">捍卫食物的</a>重新阅读。他关于饮食的高级建议很难过错，并且有很多关于他对常识性营养哲学的说法。我对他引用的一些研究不同意Pollan的意见，但是如果您坚持他的实际收获，我觉得您几乎不会被误入歧途。</p><p>现在，让我们看一下每本书中的一些笔记：</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1。沃尔特·威利特（Walter Willett）<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">吃，喝和健康</a></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright

Chan公共卫生学院共同开发，也许是当今最有信誉，受欢迎的饮食书。威利特（Willett）在护士健康研究中的工作使他成为世界上最受欢迎的营养流行病学家之一，他提供了他对科学所说的我们应该饮食健康的看法。</p><p>大多数建议适合地中海饮食模式 - 之所以如此，是因为著名的七个国家的研究发现，克里特岛居民的心脏病率要低得多，因为它们的全谷物，大量的蔬菜和海鲜，小红肉和小肉和小肉和大量橄榄油。</p><p>尽管具有无可挑剔的证书，但这本书确实与我对营养的其他一些阅读有关。 Willett继续建议适度的饮酒以进行健康，而最近的数据似乎正在破坏。<span id='easy-footnote-6-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a

title="为了澄清，长期以来一直知道过度饮酒对您不利。但是直到最近，人们认为适度的消费（例如，每天1-2杯酒）可能具有超过癌症风险的心脏益处。然而，最近的工作未能支持这一想法，发现任何饮酒对健康都不利。"><sup>6</sup></a></span>同样，威利特（Willett）主张全面减少牛奶消耗，而我读过的两本教科书都认为，将牛奶作为其钙和维生素D的常规饮食组成部分，并选择低脂选项以避免其饱和脂肪。威利特还倡导每日多种维生素，其他消息来源对此提出了质疑。鉴于来源的质量，很难说威利特或教科书在它们分歧的问题上是否正确，因此我将这些领域归结为合格的专家之间的不确定性。</p><h2

/></figure></div><p>这是我最喜欢的教科书。尽管对大多数人来说，对能源代谢的生物化学的详细解释可能是不必要的，但我喜欢更深入研究科学的解释。</p><p>例如，我不知道的一件事是，许多人体的细胞依靠葡萄糖来用于能量，但是人体无法从脂肪中产生葡萄糖（它可以从蛋白质中产生葡萄糖）。在低强度的日常活动中，脂肪燃烧的过程需要进行，但是大多数体育活动都需要一些葡萄糖才能进行性能。这是我在本月阅读的“官方”资料中阅读的极低碳水化合物饮食的许多警告之一。</p><p>有趣的是，尽管我阅读的教科书之间涵盖的样式和特定内容有所不同，但两本教科书中的健康建议实际上都是相同的。我怀疑这是因为两者都在借鉴相同的原始来源，而不是独立得出相同结论的作者。这并不意味着建议没有争议，但是至少要注意的是，似乎确实有一些营养正统观念，可以指出这是一致的。</p><h2

Worries about weight should take a back seat to eating enough to power performance.</li><li> <strong>Eat individually.</strong> Your diet must work for you, your culture and your tastebuds.</li></ol><p> Overall, I found a lot to like about Fitzgerald&#39;s book, although it&#39;s clearly aimed at avid runners, cyclists, swimmers and other athletes rather than the generally-sedentary population at large.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Power-Eating-Susan-Kleiner/dp/1492567264/">The New Power Eating</a> by Susan Kleiner with Maggie Greenwood-Robinson </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="717" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-717x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16976" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-717x1024.jpg 717w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_-768x1096.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81iwBJpj9L._SL1500_.jpg 1051w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></figure></div><p> To round out the sports-centered nutrition books, I wanted to see how prescriptions vary for strength athletes, whose main goals are building muscle and power rather than aerobic fitness.</p><p> Fortunately, the recommendations are quite similar. Carbs are also important for strength training since glucose, not fat, can be broken down anaerobically in muscle tissues for the power needed for hard workouts, and hard workouts are needed to provide the muscles with appropriate stimulus to grow.</p><p> The main difference is that the authors of this book focused, somewhat predictably, on eating more protein than was recommended in the guidance for endurance athletes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> by Michael Pollan </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16977" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_.jpg 782w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this book years ago, after liking Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/">The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</a> . At its heart, I basically agree with Pollan&#39;s advice and overall philosophy: eat real food, eat more plants, eat in moderation, and focus on cooking good food rather than consuming ultra-processed junk.</p><p> However, after reading many other books, I feel some of Pollan&#39;s tirades miss the mark. He spends a lot of time writing about how the “lipid hypothesis” that nutritionists recommended for years has been debunked. But then he casually flips back and forth between correctly rejecting the idea that all fat is bad and presenting the false idea that nutritional science has decided that saturated fats aren&#39;t worth worrying about (the consensus is that they are).</p><p> Similarly, Pollan gives a lot of space to both Gary Taubes and T. Colin Campbell. Taubes&#39; insistence that sugar is the cause of the obesity epidemic (as opposed to excess calorie consumption, in general) is <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode429/">probably false</a> . Campbell&#39;s advocacy of a strict vegetarian diet, in turn, is probably based on <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">some shaky science</a> .</p><p> That said, Pollan articulates better than anyone else I read the philosophy of eating, not just to optimize nutrition, but for living better. That means cooking real food, using whole ingredients with less processing, and trusting more traditional diets rather than scientifically engineered concoctions.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Food – Opening Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 07 Jan 2025 03:01:32 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16906 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m writing this on the first day of the fourth month in my year-long foundations project.

Untethered from good health and communal traditions, our eating behaviors are making us sick and lonely. We don&#39;t have time to cook and sit together for meals, and at the same time, obesity rates have skyrocketed.</p><p> Fixing this problem, even in one&#39;s own life, isn&#39;t easy. Just as it is evident we don&#39;t eat healthy on the whole, it is just as evident that the failure to eat healthy isn&#39;t any individual&#39;s “fault.” Our food environment has changed dramatically, and unconscious hormonal and neural signals that served our ancestors well now makes us sick.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Food History</h2><p> My own relationship with food is atypical. I had severe allergies to nuts and dairy as a child. Fortunately, I outgrew the dairy allergy, but it meant that my childhood was always centered around caution and avoidance of foods that were utterly normal to other people. I rarely had candy at Halloween, for instance, because few treats were safe. I was often the kid who brought a separate snack to a party because I didn&#39;t want to get sick.</p><p> As a teenager, I was persuaded that eating a vegetarian diet was the path to health. I read a few books, notably, <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">The China Study</a> , which made the argument that dropping animal products was a reliable path to healthy eating. Perhaps because of my early childhood experiences with food avoidance, I didn&#39;t find it difficult to stick to long-term.</p><p> I&#39;m more doubtful of the health benefits of veganism than I was as a teenager, but I still think they have a valid argument for both ethical and environmental reasons. Today, I eat fish, eggs and dairy, and I try not to be overly paranoid about other animal products in my food, consumed in small amounts—the way I see it, some degree of vegetarianism is probably better on the whole, but it&#39;s easy go overboard and be annoying to others regarding dietary restrictions.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t advocate for anyone to start eating as I do unless they are already interested in it. Most people fail to sustain extreme dietary restrictions, and it&#39;s not at all clear that meat ought to be the first thing to drop if you are simply trying to improve the health quality of your diet. Still, I tend to think a whole-food pescatarian diet is pretty healthy, so given that this is already the status quo for me, I don&#39;t feel compelled to make a shift to start eating more meat.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Food Falters</h2><p> Despite what may seem to many to be an already fairly restrictive diet, I can&#39;t say in all honesty that my eating patterns are maximally healthy. It&#39;s still possible to overeat, and plenty of junk food is totally vegan.</p><p> When I was in my early twenties, I could eat whatever I wanted without gaining any weight. Indeed, since I was often lifting weights, trying to gain weight was more frequently my challenge—I had to set an intention to try to put on pounds.</p><p> But, as I reached my late twenties, this was no longer true. Absent any special effort, I started to gain weight. At my peak, I weighed at least 20 lbs. above my typical college-aged weight and probably 15 lbs. above my ideal weight.</p><p> The reasons I gained weight were probably the same as everyone: I ate too much. I ate out frequently. Work and parenting pressures meant less sleep and more stress. I didn&#39;t exercise with the same vigor as my twenty-year-old self.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Refocusing on Health</h2><p> When I began working on my fitness foundation three months ago, I was naturally drawn to getting a head start on the reading for nutrition, too.</p><p> Owing to the confusion surrounding nutritional advice, and my own history of being overly swayed by a somewhat ideological author&#39;s advice for eating, I wanted to stick more to the science—keeping my focus on higher quality books as rated by independent reviewers, as well as following sources that scrutinize a lot of the scientific details behind dietary guidance.</p><p> This background reading, in combination with my renewed exercise habits, has led to a general improvement in my eating patterns. I&#39;ve now lost about 10 lbs. from my peak weight, even though restricting my food intake wasn&#39;t a priority.</p><p> Some of the things I strived for in the past few months that helped with this goal include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Eating more fruits and vegetables.</strong></li><li> <strong>Switching refined carbohydrates for whole grains when possible.</strong></li><li> <strong>Packing a lunch for work rather than eating out.</strong></li><li> <strong>Eating a big breakfast.</strong></li><li> <strong>Controlling portions when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Not snacking after dinner has finished.</strong></li></ul><p> These recommendations, which came up in my readings, seem to have worked well without any explicit aim to restrict calories. My case is probably atypical, but I was pleased to see that simply trying to eat healthier foods and managing my appetite seemed to be enough to lose some weight, along with the significant increase in my physical activity since the first month of this project.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Plans for the Month Ahead</h2><p> Since I&#39;ve already made many of the shifts I had initially planned to eat healthier, my focus for this month is largely trying to formalize the changes I am already doing informally.</p><p> In particular, I think the habits I want to sustain long-term are less like my earlier forays into highly restrictive eating patterns, but more about planning and preparation. The things I want to ensure I do this month include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Buy enough healthy food at the grocery store, so it&#39;s always available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Make sure I have healthy options for packing lunches.</strong></li><li> <strong>Have healthy options for snacking/desserts.</strong></li></ul><p> My breakfasts, lunches and snacks tend to be fairly independent, so I have the most control over those. But I eat dinners with my family, and I usually have a lunch or two per week with people I work with. Similarly, there are often events, family gatherings, vacations and other situations where having complete control over what I eat is unrealistic.</p><p> Therefore, for those situations less under my control, the behaviors I want to cultivate are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Choose healthier options when possible.</strong></li><li> <strong>Opt for reasonable portion sizes when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Plan ahead to eat healthy food before going to a place where only unhealthy options are available, so portion control becomes easier to attain.</strong></li></ul><p> These are guidelines, not hard rules. I think if I can be 80-90% successful with them, the moments where I indulge won&#39;t matter so much. My goal isn&#39;t to restrict myself from enjoying food I really do want, but to make it so such indulgences don&#39;t detract from an overall healthy eating pattern.</p><p> Additionally, I am taking the step of tracking what I eat for the month. This step is a bit a tedious, especially given that I&#39;m not really concerned about my dietary quality at the moment. However, since I have this month to focus on food, I figured it would give me some insight into my eating patterns that might be useful when I&#39;m no longer focusing on food, specifically.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Non-Nutritional Goals for Eating Better</h2><p> At this point, it may sound like I&#39;m trying to become a health-obsessed dieting weirdo. And I admit, this is a real concern. While it&#39;s pretty clear the standard Western diet is incredibly unhealthy, it&#39;s also pretty clear that an obsession with healthy eating is probably not great for your mental health.</p><p> My ultimate goal for the month is to establish enough strong habits and default options that thinking about healthy eating isn&#39;t an issue—it&#39;s just what I do unthinkingly in most situations. But I also want to recognize those situations where health isn&#39;t my primary goal when eating. Noticing how my plans interfere with these non-nutritional goals is also important, because I want to make my habits sustainable, and I want to eat delicious food, too.</p><p> I want to be able to enjoy family gatherings, eat at restaurants and on vacation, enjoy a wide variety of delicious foods and not feel hungry throughout the day. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on these factors as well, because a maximally healthy diet that means eating monotonous, bland meals in isolation is something I neither want nor can sustain.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Want to Improve Your Foundation for This Month?</h2><p> I&#39;m going into a lot more detail on the lessons I&#39;m gathering from my research in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> . But anyone who wants to improve how they eat is welcome to join me, informally, for this month&#39;s project.</p><p> The habit we&#39;re cultivating this month is flexible food planning. This simply means taking steps to shape your food environment, from buying healthier food at the grocery store to planning healthier meals. If you&#39;re really serious about changing your diet, you&#39;re also welcome to go all the way to fully planning your meals a week in advance and tracking your calories, but this additional step is not necessary for most people to make improvements. Even little things like dropping sugary drinks or adding more vegetables to your plate are still worth doing.</p><p> At the end of the month, I&#39;ll share notes from the books I read, as well as provide an update of how my month focused on food went.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/">Food – Opening Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Money – Month-End Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:02:21 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16886 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m now rounding out the third month in my year-long project to improve my foundations.

I’m working three months ahead of the publication of these posts to make it easier to produce all the content for my Foundations course."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus was money. In particular, the keystone habit I asked students of <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">my course</a> to work on this month was setting up a system to track their expenses and reviewing it at least monthly.</p><p> Monthly expense tracking has been a habit of mine for almost two decades, so my personal challenge this month was to:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Improve my tracking.</strong> Prior to this month, my wife and I tracked dozens of different spending categories. We reorganized our system so we have main categories and subcategories, making it easy to see how much we spend on “big picture” items while also having enough detail that we can get specific in any particular area (for instance, how much of our food costs is due to eating out versus groceries?)</li><li> <strong>Get term life insurance.</strong> I applied for term life insurance for myself. I decided to get a policy that would cover our outstanding mortgage balance, since the other financial assets I have should be enough to cover any other expenses.</li><li> <strong>Rebalance my assets.</strong> This was a concern of mine as I don&#39;t feel my asset allocation so far has been done in a particularly principled way. However, reading dozens of books (including the better part of a 1000-page textbook on investing) didn&#39;t really persuade me to change my strategy much. I probably want to start shifting some of my assets into a bond index, but I&#39;d rather do that with newer savings rather than rebalancing the investments I already have. I still think, given my age and work flexibility, an 80-90 percent equity portfolio is the way to go. </li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Foundations Conversation: Month 3 Update - Money" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbJPBlC9cpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p> Overall, my money foundation month was more about deepening my knowledge base rather than radically changing my habits. Going in, I felt pretty good about my overall savings levels, investment strategy and money management in general, but it was nice to dig a bit deeper into this topic and affirm some of my long-standing commitments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Planning for My Financial Future</h2><p> Another step I took this month was to do some explicit calculations of my financial goals. I ran a few scenarios looking at what I can expect long-term under different future conditions based on my current assets.</p><p> This exercise helped me see what my financial position would be if I tried to retire immediately, in ten years, or not until I&#39;m in my seventies. I don&#39;t plan on stopping work anytime soon, but sometimes misfortune strikes and we&#39;re not given that choice. It was a useful exercise for seeing how my financial foundation could support my family in the case that my business failed or I somehow became incapable of earning a similar income.</p><p> This kind of analysis of net worth and retirement goals is not complicated to do, but I had never actually done it before.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Feeling Good About Money</h2><p> Another thing this month helped me with was with feeling better about my money, in general. For years, I have been comfortably saving more than I was spending, so I didn&#39;t think much about money at all. But my wife and I bought a house two years ago, and the combined pressure of watching the investments we had for the down payment take a tumble, having a mortgage, and seeing interest rates rise<span id='easy-footnote-11-16886' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-16886' title="To the confused Americans, we got a 5-year variable-rate mortgage. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the default in the US, but it isn’t common here in Canada."><sup>11</sup></a></span> added some financial stress.</p><p> I don&#39;t say this as a complaint—I&#39;m acutely aware of how fortunate we are. But it was stressful, nonetheless.</p><p> Doing the work of comparing our actual spending to our current financial picture, including the variety of possible future scenarios for investment return, interest rates, and even my ability to work and continue this business, made me a lot more comfortable about our plans going forward 。 While there&#39;s a stereotype of the person who doesn&#39;t look at their bank accounts to avoid financial anxiety, I think I tend to be the opposite. If I can&#39;t see what my goals are and whether or not I&#39;m reaching them, I get more anxious about spending, especially when things like my mortgage payments jump up considerably.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Being Committed to the Strategy</h2><p> The other lesson I took from my extensive reading this month was the importance of emotional resolve in one&#39;s financial plan. It&#39;s relatively easy to describe an investing strategy, but it seems it&#39;s much harder to commit to a plan when it&#39;s losing money in the short-term, even if it is a good strategy in the long-term.</p><p> I decided not to alter my asset allocation considerably, despite all my reading. One reason for this was simply that I feel like the informational bar for making changes to your investing strategy needs to be relatively high, otherwise there&#39;s a temptation to panic when the market crashes, or chase winners when the market is irrationally high. In this sense, I feel like a relatively simple strategy with fewer funds and choices is probably better for me, even if it isn&#39;t completely optimal from a theoretical perspective. Simplicity is easier to commit to intellectually and stick to in practice even when it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s paying off. It&#39;s hard to have the discipline to rebalance your portfolio *into* the “losers” year after year to stay consistent with a strategy, so having fewer items to rebalance seems valuable  from a behavioral standpoint.</p><p> Time will tell whether my particular choices were correct, but I have become more convinced that commitment matters more than cleverness when it comes to managing investments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Updates to Fitness and Productivity</h2><p> In addition to working on my money this month, I also sustained my previous two foundations, fitness and productivity.</p><p> Fitness continued to go well. I&#39;ve now had my third month where I haven&#39;t missed a daily workout, although a couple of those defaulted to a low-intensity stretch. I now feel like my cardiovascular fitness is about as good as it&#39;s ever been. I&#39;m still rebuilding my strength to get to my past peak of about 5 years ago, but I haven&#39;t plateaued yet.</p><p> I&#39;m also about 10 lbs. lighter than when I began three months ago. Losing weight wasn&#39;t an initial goal, but it&#39;s been a nice perk.</p><p> The productivity system I initially set up continues, although I still feel like there are a few kinks that need ironing out. I think being more consistent about the weekly and daily reviews, especially the collaborative ones with my wife at the end of the week, are essential for getting the system to work smoothly.</p><p> Still, I feel like productivity was already a solid foundation for me, so this is more of an effort to smooth off some remaining rough edges.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> With the first quarter of the year-long project concluding, I&#39;m feeling good about going into the next nine months. Next month focuses on food—I&#39;ll share my opening update for that one next week!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/">Money – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Insights from Ten Useful Books on Money</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:24:48 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16859 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Want to be better with money?

This month&#39;s focus was money. You can also see my notes on books from the previous two months covering <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/10/22/what-i-learned-about-getting-in-shape-after-reading-13-books-this-month/">fitness</a> and <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/11/19/10-important-books-productivity/">productivity</a> .</p><p> Next week, I&#39;ll share some of the steps my wife and I took this month to improve our family&#39;s financial situation. But first, I want to share some notes from the ten books on finances and money management I read this month.</p><p> I&#39;m far from an expert in finance, but of all the foundations I&#39;m covering, it&#39;s one of the few where I actually have some formal training—my university degree is from the business school at University of Manitoba, and I also took several economics courses during the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> . Thus, a lot of my reading this month was a refresher rather than a first pass. Still, it can be helpful to be reminded of things we have learned before, especially if we want to implement them consistently in our behavior.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The 1-Minute Summary of What I Learned</h2><p> Here&#39;s a brief overview of the major lessons from this month&#39;s readings:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Being rich is different from looking rich.</strong> The easiest way to find yourself broke on a high income is to try to appear like you have a lot of money.</li><li> <strong>You can&#39;t beat the market.</strong> Virtually all investors are better off with simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index-investing.asp">index investing</a> than paying a professional portfolio manager.</li><li> <strong>Successful investing is more about courage than brains.</strong> Sticking to a strategy—even when it looks like you&#39;re losing money—is incredibly hard. Most investors chase past winners and end up lowering their returns, since those investments that did well in the recent past tend to be somewhat overvalued compared to the recent “losers.”</li><li> <strong>The financial industry is full of scams and predatory behavior.</strong> While agency issues exist in all fields, professional financial advising has one of the worst track records when it comes to balancing profit motives with fiduciary duty to clients.</li><li> <strong>Practice eclipses theory in investing.</strong> Empirically, investing has been solved. Theoretically, finance is still poorly understood, and many of the most widely-used models don&#39;t neatly line up with empirical tests.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Notes on the Ten Books I Read</h2><p> My favorite book of the month was Burton Malkiel&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324035439/">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a> . While Malkiel&#39;s advice does not differ substantially from what I have seen elsewhere, he does a good job explaining all the different schools of thought on investing and giving them a fair shake.</p><p> For those interested in a purely practical guide, Ramit Sethi&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> is the best. It outlines, step-by-step, the best advice for managing your money. Nothing Ramit recommends is contradicted by my other research, and his book was definitely the most comprehensive.</p><p> The most interesting/enjoyable read was Morgan Housel&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681/">The Psychology of Money</a> .</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/">The Millionaire Next Door</a> by Thomas Stanley and William Danko </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="668" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81L9R4t40OL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16862" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81L9R4t40OL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg 668w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81L9R4t40OL._SL1500_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81L9R4t40OL._SL1500_-768x1177.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81L9R4t40OL._SL1500_.jpg 979w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></figure></div><p> I have mixed feelings about this book.</p><p> On one hand, I found the detailed survey data on the habits of wealthy individuals to be fascinating. The authors gathered a treasure trove on all sorts of behaviors associated with being wealthy, down to the amount rich people spend on watches and which brands of cars they drive.</p><p> To broadly summarize, typical millionaires don&#39;t look especially rich. They often live in modest homes in modest neighborhoods and don&#39;t spend a lot of money, despite having healthy earnings. That&#39;s why they&#39;re rich.</p><p> My major annoyance with this book is that the authors invented two income-adjusted categories of individuals: Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW) and Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAW). These are people who have more or less wealth, respectively, than would be expected given their income. The authors spend much of the book continually expressing amazement at what a frugal bunch of people these PAWs are.</p><p> But this is tautologically true! If you control for income, someone with a lot of wealth <em>necessarily</em> spends less money than they could. The authors found that frugality matters because they defined their investigation so it was the only thing that <em>could</em> matter.<span id='easy-footnote-12-16859' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-16859' title="Of course, if you consider capital appreciation separately from income, it’s always possible that someone could have more wealth simply by having much better investments (or fewer losses). However, this isn’t the crux of the book (which doesn’t spend much time discussing investing itself) so the point still stands."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p><p> Savings rates definitely matter to wealth. But the authors&#39; sleight of hand makes it look as though it&#39;s the <em>only</em> thing that matters—ignoring a person&#39;s income. This is a useful trick if you want to moralize about wasteful consumption, but perhaps less honest if you&#39;re trying to ask why some people have more money than others.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/">Your Money or Your Life</a> by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="669" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-669x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16863" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-669x1024.jpg 669w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-768x1176.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_.jpg 980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></figure></div><p> A classic from the “financial independence” side of personal finance advice, I found this book helpful not for any grand insight it offered, but for its subtle reframing of how to think about money.</p><p> Most of us measure our spending in terms of dollars and cents. Robin and Dominguez, in contrast, argue that we ought to calculate our “true” wage (meaning the amount we earn minus any costs associated with our employment, such as cars for commuting, lunches at the office or clothing we wear to work) and then use that to determine how many hours and minutes everything we buy costs us. Money is a renewable resource, but our time is not—knowing how much of our life&#39;s energy we spend when we buy things can be a powerful way to curb spending.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> by Ramit Sethi </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="685" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-685x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16864" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-685x1024.jpg 685w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-201x300.jpg 201w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-768x1149.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_.jpg 1003w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></figure></div><p> I&#39;ve known Ramit for decades. Indeed, I have an email he sent me, introducing himself, when we were both still skinny, college-aged bloggers. Now he has a NYT bestselling book, a multimillion-dollar business empire and a Netflix show.</p><p> I read the first edition of Ramit&#39;s book when it came out over a decade ago, and I still think it&#39;s one of the best. Ramit is both specific and practical in his advice, giving concrete details for how to automate your savings, which banks to use, what to invest in and how to negotiate a better salary.</p><p> But beyond the advice, I think what I enjoy most about Ramit&#39;s perspective is that he manages to advocate for financial prudence without falling into the “spending is evil” trap so common in personal finance literature. While it&#39;s true that most Westerners ought to spend less and save more, if you read too many personal finance books, you might forget that you can use money to make your life better and that obsessive penny-pinching isn&#39;t the only way to live 。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Path-Wealth-financial-independence/dp/1533667926/">The Simple Path to Wealth</a> by JL Collins </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-663x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16865" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-768x1187.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_.jpg 880w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></figure></div><p> Collins takes the philosophy of index investing—that low-cost, simple portfolios beat actively managed, complex investments—to an extreme. He argues that you pretty much only need to put your money into one fund: Vanguard&#39;s total stock market portfolio.</p><p> This makes Collins a bit of a contrarian from most portfolio management perspectives. Investing 100% in stocks is generally considered a very risky portfolio. Perhaps the popularity of this strategy is simply due to the US&#39;s excellent bull market run since the Great Recession.</p><p> However, I can see the advantages of simplicity, even if it&#39;s suboptimal from the point of view of modern portfolio theory. A simpler investment has fewer traps to catch yourself in. Complicated investment schemes require you to regularly rebalance your portfolio and make it more likely for investors to try to time the market or chase supposedly superior asset classes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unconventional-Success-Fundamental-Approach-Investment-ebook/dp/B000FCKBT8?">Unconventional Success</a> by David Swensen </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="674" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-674x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16866" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-674x1024.jpg 674w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-768x1167.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_.jpg 987w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></figure></div><p> Swensen is a legendary figure in investing circles. Running Yale&#39;s endowment fund, he regularly returned better-than-market averages. In doing so, he also flipped the conventional wisdom on how to properly manage such funds on its head—arguing that the truly long-term viewpoint of endowment funds should be tilted more towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equities</a> than was traditionally considered appropriate.</p><p> While Swensen does give investing advice, the most interesting part of this book is the numerous industry stories about ways Wall Street screws over retail investors. He devotes considerable time to documenting the various scandals ranging from outright fraud to legal-but-unethical practices that pit profit motive against fiduciary duty. Sadly, it seems profit wins nearly every time.</p><p> The only piece of advice Swensen gave that diverges from other sources is his emphasis on a relatively high degree of diversification between asset classes. In this sense, he takes the opposite approach to Collins by emphasizing a mixture of US and global equities, US treasury bonds, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp">TIPS</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp">REITs</a> rather than going all-in on a single fund.</p><p> I found Swensen&#39;s approach intellectually satisfying, but his method also requires a fair degree of rebalancing to keep the portfolio strategy consistent, which can be difficult for an average investor to sustain behaviorally and can potentially incur capital gains taxes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681/">The Psychology of Money</a> by Morgan Housel </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="662" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-662x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16867" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-662x1024.jpg 662w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-768x1188.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_.jpg 970w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></figure></div><p> This was fun to listen to as an audiobook. Housel is an excellent writer. He weaves together fascinating stories about our all-too-human failings with money and ties them to universal principles of sound money management.</p><p> Perhaps my favorite anecdote from the book was the amount by which people underrate compound interest. Warren Buffett is rich, having over $140 billion. He&#39;s a good investor, making roughly 20% annualized returns. But—and this fact is less often emphasized—he is also <em>really</em> old. Starting at age 10, he has been seriously investing for 84 years!</p><p> Housel calculates that if Buffett had started investing at 30 and retired at 65, his final net worth would be a little over $11 million (with an <em>m</em> , not a <em>b</em> ), even including his impressive return rate. Compound interest is hard for our brains to comprehend.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing/dp/1119404509/">The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</a> by John Bogle </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81vPxCvGMcL._SL1500_-724x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16868" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81vPxCvGMcL._SL1500_-724x1024.jpg 724w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81vPxCvGMcL._SL1500_-212x300.jpg 212w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81vPxCvGMcL._SL1500_-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81vPxCvGMcL._SL1500_.jpg 1061w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure></div><p> Bogle has done more for the average investor than perhaps any other individual in history. He launched The Vanguard Group and pioneered the practice of index investing. Today, an investor can match the return rate of the entire stock market for less than a tenth of a percentage point in fees every year.</p><p> This book summarizes Bogle&#39;s case for index investing, drawing on extensive expert testimony explaining why buying shares in the entire stock or bond market and simply holding them regardless of market movements is the correct investment strategy for most investors.</p><p> Bogle&#39;s advice is simple, but it&#39;s far from simplistic. The advice to put your money in index funds is nearly universal among academics, and it&#39;s similarly common among professional money managers (at least when they&#39;re not trying to sell you a specific product they may profit from).</p><p> Bogle is contrarian in his focus on only domestic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">securities</a> and his dismissal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund">ETFs</a> . I tend to think some international diversification is prudent (although higher fees need to be accounted for), and that ETFs are in some ways a better investing vehicle than traditional mutual funds (although it depends on the exact fund). Those two points excepted, I agreed with virtually everything Bogle had to say about where to put your money.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1427769907?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title">Personal Financial Planning: Theory and Practice</a> by Michael Dalton and James Dalton </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="394" height="500" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16869" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L.jpg 394w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></figure></div><p> This textbook was a whopper.

Such models predict that large stock market movements which have actually occurred ought to be nearly theoretically impossible.

Malkiel, a Princeton economist, covers a lot of intellectual ground in how to think about investing while writing in engaging prose and giving practical advice.</p><p> While I read a lot of books that basically argued for broad-based, low-cost index investing, I felt Malkiel gave the fairest description of the major competing philosophies, from technical and fundamental analysis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">“greater fool” theory</a> of behavioral finance.</p><p> Malkiel&#39;s book has long been a classic of investing, but I also appreciate how he updates it frequently to fit current circumstances, even including discussions of cryptocurrency in the most recent edition. While the core principles haven&#39;t changed between editions, the actual experience of the market has changed many times, so it&#39;s nice to see these principles applied across various time periods.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/">Insights from Ten Useful Books on Money</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> My Best Essays in 2024</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/10/best-of-2024/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/10/best-of-2024/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16842 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A quick recap of my best writing in 2024.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/10/best-of-2024/">My Best Essays in 2024</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> As we head towards the end of the year, I thought it would be nice to recap some of my best writing from the past twelve months, in case you missed it.</p><p> I published <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/articles/">48 essays</a> to the blog this year (plus another two for my Foundations project which will come out before year&#39;s end). More significantly, this year also saw the publishing of my second book, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/getbetter/">Get Better at Anything</a> , as well as the launch of my new course and project, <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations</a> .</p><p> Here are my favorite essays from 2024:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/01/23/10000-hr-rule-myth/">The 10,000 Hour Rule is a Myth</a> . The common interpretation of this rule directly contradicts the research that was used to create it. But even more, the idea that a particular number of hours leads to achieving mastery is a kind of category error in thinking.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/04/09/science-of-mental-models/">The Science of Mental Models</a> . My review of Philip Johnson-Laird&#39;s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-We-Reason-Philip-Johnson-Laird-ebook/dp/B001KYEZRO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KXGAKCTSD508&amp;keywords=How+We+Reason&amp;qid=1701800017&amp;sprefix=,aps,208&amp;sr=8-1">How We Reason</a> explains how his theory of mental models reconciles how we can have science and philosophy, despite our frequent reasoning mistakes.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/06/18/doing-too-much/">You&#39;re Trying to Do Too Much</a> . The difference between additive and subtractive productivity, and why the latter is underrated in our age of constant busyness.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/07/02/foundations-for-good-life/">The Universal Foundations for a Good Life</a> . My essay introducing the idea of foundations—universal habits and skills that underpin a good life—that led to my current year-long project.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/08/06/the-three-gaps/">The Three Gaps</a> . There are three gaps that exist between ideal conduct and our actual practice: between the best possible approach and what experts think is best; between what experts think is best and what everyday people think is best; and between what everyday people think is best and what they actually do. I argue that the third gap is perhaps the largest (and most stubborn) to close in most areas of our life.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/11/12/multiple-languages-overrated/">Is Speaking Multiple Languages Overrated?</a> I love learning languages. But is it better to spend more time mastering one language, or to dabble in a few? Here I present the case against my own bias towards polyglottism, arguing that most people are probably better off getting really good at a second language rather than adding a third, fourth (or seventh!).</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/02/13/6-causes-of-burnout/">The 6 Causes of Burnout (and How to Avoid It)</a> . A look at leading burnout researcher Christina Maslach&#39;s work on the real reasons we burn out.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/10/08/5-tips-staying-focused/">5 Tips for Staying Focused (When You&#39;re Stressed)</a> . A lot of readers told me this was their favorite essay in the past year, helping them cope with their own stresses.

It&#39;s highly technical, driven by spreadsheets and equations—but it&#39;s also emotionally charged, driven by greed and fear.</p><p> Nobody naturally thinks about money the purely rational way economists say we should—instead, we come with the enormous baggage of our beliefs about how we should think and value money.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Care About Money?</h2><p> Unlike fitness or productivity, which many people overlook, few elements of modern life are as omnipresent as money. If you work, you probably spend much of your daily life doing things in order to get money. In your off time, you spend even more time thinking about how to spend, save or invest the money you earned.</p><p> This obsession with money tends to cause extreme views on its true importance. On one end are people who derive their self-worth from their net worth and judge those around them by the size of their bank account. On the other end are those who insist that money doesn&#39;t matter at all.</p><p> The truth is somewhere in between.</p><p> Money alone can&#39;t make you happy—but it can provide options in your life that do offer happiness: financial freedom, not needing to work for extra years into your retirement, being able to travel or get an education. Money makes a difference.</p><p> At the same time, the idea that becoming really rich will somehow fix all your problems is perhaps one of the greatest self-delusions. Financial health matters, but your physical health matters more, as do your relationships with your kids, friends and family members.</p><p> So it&#39;s with some trepidation that I write about money, one of the most emotionally-charged and contentious topics in this entire project. But it&#39;s these very emotions money evokes that make it worth exploring in more depth.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Money Story</h2><p> I have been incredibly fortunate in my life. Financially, my family and I are well-off. I&#39;ve been financially independent since my early twenties. I&#39;ve never had any consumer or student debt. And for nearly two decades, I&#39;ve earned more than I spent, leading to fairly substantial savings.<span id='easy-footnote-15-16831' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/03/money-day-one/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-16831' title="I went to university at a school in Canada where annual tuition was less than $6000. I paid for it mostly through scholarships and jobs I worked."><sup>15</sup></a></span></p><p> Looking back, I can see three sources of amazing luck I&#39;ve had in my life that helped me arrive where I am today:</p><p> First, my parents. My parents were both public school teachers, and we lived in a modest home in a small town. They offered me some help with accommodations during my first couple years of university, but otherwise did not pay my tuition or living expenses. Since then, I haven&#39;t received any financial assistance from them or any other relatives.</p><p> <strong>But my parents gave me something worth far more than an inheritance: they showed me how to live within my means.</strong> My parents always stuck to a budget, paid credit cards off in full and never took out loans for anything other than a car or house. These financial behaviors are so normal for me that it took years before I understood that some people buy things on credit cards when they don&#39;t have enough money to pay for it in their chequing account.</p><p> To be fair, my parents weren&#39;t poor or cheap, either. We had the good fortune of living a solid middle-class lifestyle where paying for food, shelter, books and the occasional vacation was never an issue. Financial prudence and stability were part of my childhood, which I belatedly learned is often not the case.</p><p> <strong>My second source of good fortune was deciding to go into business for myself in my late teens.</strong> After learning about “solopreneur” software developers when I was fifteen, my life&#39;s dream became to run an independent online business.</p><p> On its own, there&#39;s nothing particularly prudent about my choice. It was a gamble then, certainly. While making money online is the dream of the average teenager today, it was almost unimaginable to a normal person in 2004.</p><p> In the beginning, my goal was modest: I wanted to make $20,000 a year, which was enough money to live off my business full-time. If I could hit that threshold, I would be able to devote myself to growing the business. Despite that initially modest target, it still took me seven years of near-constant work to reach it.</p><p> During that time, I lived quite frugally. But, again, I was a college student. Everyone around me was broke too, so there was no difficulty or stigma for living cheaply as I worked on my side hustle. When I finally did start earning past my original goal, I was so used to living cheaply that I was fine letting my business income contract during projects like the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> or my <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">Year Without English</a> .</p><p> Since then, my business has grown. I&#39;ve hired a team, published a bestselling book, and partnered with Cal Newport on two course projects.<span id='easy-footnote-16-16831' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/03/money-day-one/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-16831' title="Another stroke of good luck: befriending Cal when we were still both students writing about studying."><sup>16</sup></a></span></p><p> In the rearview mirror, those decisions appear prescient. It turns out 2006 was an excellent time to start writing online. The first project that put me over my initial goal, a monthly study-skills subscription, was a decade before Substack made premium content subscriptions a widely-accepted business model.</p><p> While it would be easy to pat myself on the back for my foresight, the truth is that I got lucky. Yes, there was a lot of hard work, but the wind was at my back in ways I cannot take credit for.</p><p> The third source of good fortune in my financial life was <strong>learning the right way to invest money early, and saving a substantial portion of my earnings</strong> .</p><p> Before I knew much about business or finance, I was lucky to get pushed toward the idea that investing in low-cost index funds is the best financial strategy. This belief was further reinforced as I went through business school and studied finance formally. By the time I was in a position to save anything, I was able to put most of my extra income into one of the best-performing vehicles for growing wealth.</p><p> This was fortunate. In the early days of my personal development, I spent a lot of time reading advice for various life domains online. I shudder to think of what I might have put my money in had I heeded the advice to pick stocks, gamble with leveraged investments, or chase crypto fortunes that pervades internet discussions today.</p><p> Instead, my money has mostly grown steadily in the decade-and-a-half I&#39;ve been able to invest.</p><p> I bring up these three points not to brag—there are plenty of people who are much richer or savvier money managers than me—but to underscore the outsized role luck plays in financial health. Good practices matter, I know people who were dealt better hands than I was but still struggle with money problems, but few domains are as skewed to the vagaries of chance as money. And in this case, I can count myself extremely lucky.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Plan for the Month</h2><p> In the Foundations course, <strong>this month&#39;s focus is tracking spending</strong> . Getting a complete picture of your financial health and habits is necessary for making adjustments, and most people don&#39;t track their money adequately to do this. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16838" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07-Money-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> Since I&#39;ve maintained this habit pretty consistently for nearly two decades, my personal goals for the month diverge slightly from what I&#39;m advocating in the course. In particular, I want to look at three areas of improvement:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Updating our family&#39;s monthly expense tracking.</strong> Since getting married, my wife and I have kept joint expense spreadsheets for our household. We&#39;ve been through a few versions of these, but I want to make some tweaks to make the system is easier to use. I also want to more clearly incorporate other aspects of our personal balance sheet so it&#39;s easier to see if we&#39;re on track to reach our financial goals.</li><li> <strong>Improving my investing.</strong> I already invest in low-cost index funds. For the last decade, I&#39;ve mostly ignored my investing strategy, preferring to park any extra money in index funds and let the stock market do whatever it will. However, now that I&#39;m managing more money, there are probably gains to be made by improving my asset allocation and investment timing decisions.<span id='easy-footnote-17-16831' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/03/money-day-one/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-16831' title="For instance, there&amp;#8217;s a well-documented home-country bias in investing. Additionally, owing to my practice of investing when I feel I have money to spare rather than on some disciplined timetable, I’ve probably trailed the true market performance through bad market timing. At the beginning of the pandemic, for instance, I held onto extra cash for fear of a further market crash—in fact, that would have been an excellent time to invest."><sup>17</sup></a></span></li><li> <strong>Getting life insurance.</strong> For the longest time, I didn&#39;t really worry about insurance. I had no dependents and enough emergency funds to cover almost any eventuality. Now, I&#39;m a provider for my family, and if I were to suddenly die or couldn&#39;t work, it could make it hard for my family to continue to live as we do currently.</li></ul><p> Since I already feel comfortable with my basic money management, I&#39;m using this month as a chance to deepen my knowledge and to look for things I might be missing. I have a 1000+ page textbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Financial-Planning-Theory-Practice/dp/1427794502">Personal Financial Planning: Theory and Practice</a> , on my desk right now and another large textbook on investing arriving in a few days. While a lot of it seems to be things I already know, there&#39;s always a chance I&#39;m missing something that could make a material difference.</p><p> Despite my current material comfort, I never really strived to be rich. Instead, I wanted to be free to choose how I work and live without needing to worry about money. Many of the residual worries I have around money seem to stem more from my beliefs than my bank accounts. And so another major focus in my reading for the month is going to be on that psychology—not just to be materially secure, but to foster the psychological security that money cannot buy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Want to Improve Your Money Foundation for This Month?</h2><p> While I&#39;ll be going into a lot more detail on the financial advice I&#39;m reading (and have read over the last two decades) in the Foundations course, anyone following this challenge here is free to join too.</p><p> All you need to do to participate is to <strong>start tracking your spending and conducting a monthly review to ensure you&#39;re moving toward your goals</strong> . I use a custom spreadsheet, but the service <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YouNeedABudget.com</a> has been recommended to me multiple times as an excellent tool. I also recommend Ramit Sethi&#39;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> , which is a fairly comprehensive guide for mastering the basics of your financial life.</p><p> At the end of the month, I&#39;ll share some notes from the books I read, as well as offer some final reflections on which changes I made in the month to improve this important foundation.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/03/money-day-one/">Money – Day One</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/03/money-day-one/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
