class="wp-block-heading">我学到的1分钟摘要</h2><p>这是我读过的八本书中的一些快速收获：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>好朋友让您更健康。</strong>拥有更好社交网络的人的寿命更长，孤独和孤立的健康影响在同一球场上，众所周知的危险，例如吸烟。</li><li><strong>熟人也很重要。</strong>尽管我们大多数人的重点是建立深厚的友谊，但有一个关于“弱关系”的作用的文献，或者您很少见到的人，对于寻找工作机会或口碑的机会更为重要。</li><li><strong>友谊不是很快。</strong>估计成为朋友所需的时间是60多个小时的面对面联系。这个门槛解释了为什么您可以经常进行社交，但仍然无法交朋友 - 如果您没有持续的机会与同一人进行社交，那么许多潜在的友谊在达到60多个小时以上的门槛之前就会下降。</li><li><strong><em>兴趣</em>比<em>兴趣</em>更好。</strong>人们以自我为中心。我们喜欢喜欢我们的人，他们对我们的利益以及真正想听的人感兴趣。</li><li><strong>民主本身可能受到威胁。</strong>自1960年代以来，社区和公民生活从第二次世界大战后的山峰开始枯萎。社会基础设施的这种衰败可能是我们集体不信任和两极分化的主要原因。</li></ol><p>总的来说，我发现这个话题比我预期的要深得多，导致了一些个人认识，下周我将讨论这些意识。现在，关于我读过的每本书的笔记...</p><h2

作者认为，大多数人犯了讨价还价的错误，例如在街头市场上的hagglers，他们一直在说出自己的“最佳价格”，直到他们达成协议或走开。这引起的不舒服的冲突使某些人努力走去，试图挤压另一个人的风险，或者变得柔和，试图容纳未能获得您真正想要的东西的风险。</p><p>相反，作者建议我们应该就原则而不是立场进行谈判。将人们与问题分开；专注于您的兴趣，而不是您的立场本身；寻找相互利益的选择；当您必须妥协时，请寻找目标标准和原则来确定公平性。</p><h3

普特南（Putnam）拥有数百张图表和统计数据，从俱乐部会员资格，教堂出勤，志愿服务，政治行动主义甚至野餐的各种社会下降措施中走动。总体而言，人们花费的时间比1960年代的公共生活鼎盛时期要少。</p><p>这本书的标题是：在写作时，保龄球比以往任何时候都多，但保龄球<em>联赛的</em>人数却少得多。<span id='easy-footnote-1-17132'

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>许多建议集中于该怎么做，但是专注于退出的建议相对较少。走的每条路径必然意味着另一条路径被忽略，因此两者必须平等重要。</p><p>在某些方面，选择退出比选择采取行动要困难。我们都知道我们应该锻炼，阅读，冥想，社交，努力工作，与家人共度时光，并每天喝八杯水。但是，当该清单不可避免地变得难以管理时，很难说我们应该停止什么。</p><p>戒烟的重要性不太经常讨论的另一个原因是，有价值的追求通常具有挑战性，而且很容易屈服于早期困难。 “永不放弃”是一个不切实际的口号，但是在我们很想放弃梦想并观看Netflix的情况下，它可能会很好地为我们服务。</p><p>因为我们将更多的时间用于思考我们应该进行的项目，而不是我们应该放弃的项目，所以后者往往会冲动发生。我们辞职是因为我们疲倦，无聊或其他事情似乎更具吸引力。   我认为这是一个错误。更故意思考何时放弃可能会改善我们的决策，而不仅仅是选择更多任务以添加到我们的待办事项清单中。</p><p>这是您可以要求自己帮助做出决定的四个问题。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1。过去完成了。未来的好处大于未来的成本吗？</h2><p>从弄清楚理想理性的人在您的情况下会做什么，通常会有所帮助。如果您可以咨询永远不会感到疲倦或沮丧的甲骨文，并且可以计算出正确的决定，她会告诉您做什么？</p><p>口腔不存在，因此我们必须为经济理论而定。一个关键的概念是<a

/></figure></div><p>在这种情况下，对沉没成本的分析使我们无法尽早戒烟，但可以很容易地采取行动。</p><p>假设您花了三年的时间从​​事商业想法。最初，市场看起来很有希望，因此您辞职，花了三年时间尝试建立一家公司。但是，现在，预测看起来令人沮丧。您认为至少要花费三年的时间才能进行它 - 还有其他机会可能会更好。您应该继续课程还是切换？</p><p>再一次，过去三年没关系。即使事实证明这些时间浪费时间，他们也不应该改变您的决定。最重要的是，您将投资的未来时间（和金钱）是否可以持续或退出。</p><p>经济观点鼓励分离。问题不是“如果我必须重新开始，我会接受这个项目吗？”取而代之的是“继续戒烟的价值是什么（与我的替代方案相比）？”</p><p>有时，一个半完成的项目您不再对完成更有意义的完成，因为完成它所需的工作很少。有时，您的追求使您的灵魂倾注需要被抛弃，因为使它起作用所需的未来投资不值得回报。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2。不要急于采取行动。重新评估出口的最佳点是什么时候？</h2><p>经济观点很有用，但这只是故事的一部分。毕竟，如果我们可以轻松地做出关于是否坚持下去还是放弃的决定，决定要做什么（或退出）将不会那么棘手。真正的困难是，我们在无法放开项目和放弃闪亮的新追求的项目之间交替，在任何情况下都明确权衡我们选择的优点。情绪而不是理由，在我们的决策中迫在眉睫。</p><p>做出决定时，我们无法消除情绪。即使可以的话，我们也不想这样做。正如神经科学家安东尼奥·达马西奥（Antonio Damasio） <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Descartes-Error-Emotion-Reason-Human-ebook/dp/B00AFY2XVK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1644646701&amp;sr=8-1">所说明的那样</a>，对大脑情绪中心损害的患者不是高效的瓦肯人，而是无望丢失了 - 在不重要的任务上差不多，因为他们无法正确评估最重要的事情。</p><p>但是有一个快乐的媒介。我们可以驯服一些最糟糕的冲动的一种方式，而不会破坏情绪对决策的真正价值，就是创建可以影响我们决策的结构。</p><p>我发现的一种结构特别有用的是<strong>提前定义您的退出点。</strong>通过设置具有明确定义的退出坡道的项目，您可以确保不会基于瞬间诱惑做出决定。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17120" style="width:450px"

/></figure></div><p>例如，我倾向于在集中爆发中学习学习项目，而不是做出终身承诺。这样做的部分原因是，要在三十天内学习新语言要比自动假设我想要或能够投资终生要容易得多。 30天是一个相对较小的承诺，因此即使我不喜欢它，也更容易加强我的承诺。</p><p>可能会有所帮助的另一个结构是为任何退出决定创建自动延迟或审核期。当您确信自己想放弃时，请在一个星期或一个月内提醒您重新评估。对于更大的目标，您可能需要设置一旦经历了特别压力的时期，例如决定是否在大型项目结束后辞职，或者决定在期末考试后是否想切换专业人士，因此您是从相对中立做出决定的。</p><p>在这两种情况下，前任期间的长度至关重要。太短了，您将允许临时的冲动来推动您的决定。太长了，您可能无法忍受，默认会引起情感反应，而不是理性的反应。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3。草并不总是更绿。我当前课程的替代方案的日常现实是什么？</h2><p>挫败感和压力只是一个情绪因素。分心可能是一个更大的问题。您多久启动一次目标，只是发现自己朝着一个看起来更好的机会迈进了一个新的目标？</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory">约束级别的理论</a>认为，我们倾向于使用不同的参考框架来评估决策：我们理想地看待崇高的目标，省略它们的复杂性和细节，并且我们每天务必务实地列表，重点是方便的。但这使我们失败了，因为我们当前的项目得到了艰巨的待遇，而任何新的追求都可以通过构想主义的朦胧镜头来看待。在这种情况下，谁不想切换？</p><p>克服这种认知幻想的一种方法是<strong>给自己一个简短，现实的经验，可以追求您的选择</strong>。如果您正在考虑切换专业，请从潜在的新领域参加完整的课程（包括家庭作业和考试）。如果您正在考虑切换市场，请制作原型并尝试推销它。低调的承诺通常可以帮助我们意识到，新的追求与当前的追求一样多，并且可以缓解切换的愿望。</p><p>如果您无法详细详细体验新的追求时间，有时将当前项目重新转移到更高的解释水平上，以进行更公平的比较会很有帮助。花一两个小时关于您的项目的最终目标和价值观。最初让您对此感到兴奋的是什么？</p><p>最后，我定期采用的策略是拖延。当我获得新的项目想法时，我故意将它们放在后燃烧器上。拖延通常被视为恶习，但是拖延可能的分心意味着我最终完成了更多的项目。其中一些“有一天”的项目将成为现实，但是当他们被证明是暂时的冲动时，许多项目将完全被遗忘。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4。知道你的价值观。你不会越过哪些线？</h2><p>情绪有时会导致我们冲动地退出，但它们也可以导致我们留在我们应该离开的情况下。有时候，不退出是一个更糟糕的决定，因为在差异，工作或项目中坚持下去会浪费我们的数年生活，几乎没有花时间和精力来表现出来。确实，虽然过早辞职有其成本，但坚持失败的追求的痛苦是真正的悲剧。</p><p><strong>即使您想留下来，也要清楚，明确的规则，即使您何时辞职。</strong>在某些情况下，我会主张退出：</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>追求不再与您深入的价值观保持一致。</strong>例如，如果您对工作有一个理解，但后来意识到坚持下去将需要以与您的价值观相反的方式背叛您的内部道德准则或行为，那么退出是最好的。</li><li><strong>追求的成本显然超出了其收益，并且没有明显的短期退出。</strong>我经常会努力完成（如果项目的终结结束）（我认为值得培养中等程度的毅力），该项目（温和）失败了成本效益测试。但是，如果成本大大高于收益，或者如果没有明显的自然出口以进行追捕，则通常需要退出。</li><li><strong>您正在尝试弥补已经发生的损失。</strong>人性在一个地方倾向于非理性地劝阻退出，那就是当我们失去某些东西并且迫切希望“消除”这种损失时。赌徒称这是“倾斜”，在那儿，由于赌注不好，球员不再进行理性分析。</li></ul><p>每个决定都是唯一的，因此没有一个正确的答案来辞职。但是，如果您有一个思考这些决定的过程，那么您将更有可能降落在合理的选择中。</p><p><a

/></figure></div><p>我认为我不需要阐明关系对美好生活的重要性。我们生活中几乎所有的喜悦（以及我们最深切的苦难）都建立在我们与他人的联系上。</p><p>我选择首先专注于外展，因为它是与更深层次联系的逻辑前提。如果您没有很多亲密的朋友或浪漫的伴侣，那么您一生中根本没有很多关系，您就有机会加深。因此，结识新朋友或加强“弱关系”是首先。</p><p>在与他们成为亲密朋友之前，首先需要与他们结识的逻辑上的必要性并不是我一生中的实际问题。我很高兴与两个孩子结婚。我与家人有良好的关系，而且我个人和专业都有许多密友。</p><p>但是，我肯定有这个测序很重要的时候。我在二十多岁的时候就走了很多东西，我不得不从头开始重建一个社交世界。因此，我第一手知道，在社会成功方面，外展的基础是多么重要。</p><p>我认为，将外展视为与另一个原因不同的原因也很有意义：支持每个人的行为和技能往往是不同的。加深的联系在很大程度上是花费美好的时间，善解人意和慷慨的问题，但外展依赖于外向性，自信心和开放性来尝试新事物。从实际的角度来看，考虑与维持现有紧密联系的工作独立的基础是有意义的。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">反思我目前的外展</h2><p>我的宣传基础比我想要的要弱，尽管其中一部分是与我一生相对较强的先前时代的比较。</p><p>在二十多岁的时候，我几乎每天都有一个社交活动。在我的业务早期，我花了很多时间与其他作家和企业家接触。搬到新的地方后，社交以帮助我建立新朋友（通常用我说得不太好）是我的重中之重。</p><p>但是，今天，我与我不知道的人进行社交水平要低得多。其中很大一部分只是我一生的当前阶段。有两个小孩在家，我的时间更少，坦率地说，要寻找新朋友的动力。我经常觉得我没有足够的时间来维持我已经拥有的许多友谊，从不介意以结识新朋友的明确目的进行社交活动。</p><p>但是，从简单的忙碌中驳斥了宣传的需求太容易了。同样的论点可能适用于许多其他基础。我不会参加运动，当您是忙碌的父母时，保持某种体质的需求就不那么突出了，但是随着年龄的增长，这种体质并不会使健身不重要。同样，我认为对外展的完全忽视很容易导致这种情况，在这种情况下，从孤立的茧中出现了早期父母的茧，我发现自己与我想要的更少的朋友和活动。一个类比可能是一个大学运动员，没有注意到他们在三十多岁和四十多岁的时候就变得不明显了，发现他们现在在老年时有可预防的健康问题。最好在弱点引起问题<em>之前</em>修复基础。</p><p>尽管如此，鉴于我的生活限制以及目前的朋友和家人的供应，我想在宣传花费的适当时间与维持现有的关系和承诺之间取得适当的平衡。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">基斯通习惯：每周社交活动</h2><p>鉴于需要进行一些宣传和我现有的承诺，我认为旨在养成大约每周一次社交活动的习惯可能是理想的选择。与我的健身习惯不同，鉴于社交事件的不规则性质，我的目标是几乎完全一致性，我不太关心这种习惯的严格性。我认为，如果我达到〜1倍/周的平均水平，那就太好了。</p><p>我的社交活动标准是有机会结识新朋友。这可能是我还不认识任何人的聚会，课程或小组活动。或者可能是我与现有朋友参加的活动，我还不认识所有参加会议的人。</p><p>每周一次听起来像是一个很好的最小承诺。很难想象一个每周一次的郊游会过多的人，但是我绝对可以考虑某些人每周一次的社交活动太少。当我是一个新的城市，单身，试图在职业上获得立足点，或者只是在我的生活中缺少朋友时，那肯定太少了。因此，我认为这不是通用的基准，尽管对于大多数人来说，它可能是合理的最低阈值。</p><p>为了实现这一目标，我正在做我一直做的事情：根据我的一些兴趣找到聚会，向朋友询问他们的活动，并让我睁开眼睛寻求机会。由于我最近一直在跑步，所以我可能会参加一个或两个跑步俱乐部，并通过日常运动来杀死两只石头。</p><p>我也很想重新启动一些语言练习。这是我喜欢kid的东西，但是随着大流行取消了所有面对面的会议，以及对生两个婴儿的需求增加，我几乎完全放弃了。因此，我也会关注这一点。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">其他外展指标</h2><p>我要优先于每周参加一些社交活动，以进行我的外展活动。这部分是因为我在这个基础中的需求非常非特异。如前所述，我幸福地结婚了，所以激励很多社交活动的约会角度对我而言。</p><p>同样，尽管我总是可以在专业网络中做得更好，但这也不是我要优先考虑的领域。我总是很乐意在职业上认识人们，但是我觉得我在职业生涯的这一点上有机地获得了足够的机会，这不需要很多额外的工作。</p><p>但是，除了每周的社交习惯外，我还希望与更遥远的朋友保持时间和安排时间。我自然而然地擅长于此，并且不在社交媒体上会使情况变得更糟。在为朋友设置CRM软件似乎有些不人道化时，我认为我确实需要一些提醒系统才能至少检查这些人，以免失去联系。</p><p>我还没有确切决定要使用哪种系统。过去，我已经尝试了反复提醒和电子表格来解决这个问题，但是我总是对它们的形式有所帮助。取而代之的是，我可能会尝试更常规的练习，以弥补我对社交媒体上人们更新的意识。</p><p>与往常一样，到本月底，我将分享我本月阅读的一些见解，以及计划中的习惯改变。</p><p><a

for the month.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Reflections on Reading</h2><p> As evidenced by my previous months&#39; book lists, I already read a lot of books. This is largely an occupational side-effect, but my reading volume isn&#39;t something that concerns me. </p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Foundations Conversation Month 5 Update - Reading" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3WZCQmljhc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p> Instead, my goals for the month were twofold:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>To read, however briefly, right before bed</strong> . I felt like this habit would facilitate sleeping well, in addition to injecting another regular reading slot into my life.</li><li> <strong>To expand the breadth of books I read</strong> . I wanted to spend more time reading literature, history and topics not directly related to my writing. (Though I admit such breadth will probably not be sustained outside of this initial month.)</li></ol><p> For both goals, I was successful:</p><p> I managed to read every night before falling asleep, although on nights spent with company, my wife and I went to bed later, and I kept this reading brief. I will strive to continue this habit, especially when I approach the month when my project focuses on sleep itself. Books beat screens for improving sleep quality.</p><p> In terms of breadth, I was also successful. In particular, I focused on two books I have wanted to read that kept getting pushed out of my queue by more “important” books: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-667x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17070" style="width:107px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-195x300.jpg 195w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_.jpg 977w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17071" style="width:164px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong><em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> .</strong> This is my all-time favorite novel.

Given this month&#39;s focus, I restarted where I left off and have nearly reach the end.</li><li> <strong><em>Journey to the West</em> .</strong> This Chinese classic has been sitting on my shelf since my first trip to China, but the Chinese text was too difficult for me.

Thus, in an ironic twist, the month focused on reading is probably the one in which I finished the fewest total books!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Reading about Reading: Notes on Five Books</h2><p> In addition to my literary excursions, I read five books about reading for this month&#39;s research, two of which were re-reads. This is a lot less than I normally read for <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations</a> each month. Part of this was owing to the amount of time I took to read longer books that were off-topic, as mentioned earlier. But a bigger part was simply that I have already read a ton of books on this topic as part of researching <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/getbetter/">my latest book</a> , so I didn&#39;t feel compelled to research the topic as aggressively as I do the subjects that are new to me.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1-Minute Summary of What I Learned</h2><p> First, some quick takeaways from this month&#39;s research:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Reading relies on brain mechanisms that evolved to do different jobs</strong> , that are recycled to be applied to the evolutionarily-recent task of reading.</li><li> <strong>Despite differences in scripts, reading in Chinese, English and Italian all use basically the same brain circuitry</strong> .</li><li> <strong>Reading speed is mechanically and psychologically limited</strong> . Speed reading doesn&#39;t work, and the upper limit on reading (without skimming or skipping stuff) is probably around 500 words per minute for most people.</li><li> <strong>Knowledge is the biggest driver of comprehension and memory</strong> . The more you know the more you&#39;ll remember from what you read. Ultimately this, not speed, is probably the biggest factor separating people who easily read dozens of books in a month and those who find one or two to be arduous.</li><li> <strong>Reading is a virtuous cycle</strong> . In keeping with my fourth point, if you read more, you know more, which makes further reading easier and more enjoyable. Reading well comes from reading lots.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Notes on Five Books</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Mind-Cognitive-Approach-Understanding/dp/1119301378">The Reading Mind</a> by Daniel Willingham </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17072" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this when it came out. Now, having done a lot more background research on reading, I can appreciate just how good a job Willingham does in covering the basic cognitive science of reading.</p><p> Willingham carefully articulates the current standard model for how reading works, from moving your eyes, to decoding letters on the page, to the dual routes of sounding out words while accessing irregular ones through a mental lexicon, assembling words into propositions, determining what a book says and, finally, what it actually means. Along the way, he dispels many myths and misconceptions about this process held by educators and readers alike.</p><p> My favorite part of this book was Willingham&#39;s discussion of how limited our field of vision is—and how unaware we are of this. Researchers using eye-tracking software transformed a page of text to replace every character outside a narrow range of vision with the letter “X”, quickly updating the display every time a person&#39;s eye moved. Not only did this change have no effect on reading speed—subjects didn&#39;t even realize there was anything strange about the text!</p><p> Truly, the things most familiar to us contain some of the greatest surprises.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095/">How to Read a Book</a> by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="659" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17073" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg 659w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-193x300.jpg 193w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-768x1193.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_.jpg 966w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></figure></div><p> This classic has long been recommended to me, but it never made its way out of my book queue. I figured this month was as good a time as any to actually finish it.</p><p> The book is well-argued. It articulates a demanding form of “analytical” reading to be applied to the close reading of particular books. The authors argue from the point of view of a reader determining, solely from his or her own efforts and without relying on external commentary, what a book means.</p><p> On the one hand, it&#39;s hard to fault much of the advice given in the book, which I found beneficial. And it certainly helped me reflect on my own research process which mirrors the “syntopical” reading they discuss near the end.</p><p> And yet, through my research over the past few years, I&#39;ve become more inclined to believe in the “knowledge-centric” view of reading competency rather than the “skills-based” view, especially in light of educational evidence that excessive reliance on skills training has pretty sharp diminishing returns and that what students generally need most is more knowledge.</p><p> Still, I think Adler and Van Doren&#39;s book is a classic for a reason, and it outlines a useful strategy for tackling books that might otherwise seem too daunting even to consider.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Paper-Evidence-based-Healthcare/dp/111948474X/">How to Read a Paper</a> by Trisha Greenhalgh </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-663x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17074" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-768x1186.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_.jpg 971w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this when embarking on my research project for my first book, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . While aimed at medical practitioners, the advice in this book is useful to anyone who wants to make sense of, or apply recommendations from, quantitative research.</p><p> There&#39;s a danger in becoming halfway educated on a topic and, as someone who is halfway educated about many things, I&#39;m well aware of the risks. It&#39;s all too easy to see a study cited or read a single book and feel like that&#39;s the end of the story on a contentious topic. It rarely is.</p><p> Still, I think we live in a media ecosystem which increasingly requires us to understand scientific work in order to evaluate claims in health, education, politics and beyond. In short, we&#39;re all unavoidably doing the kind of amateur research that often backfires into overconfidence in shoddy opinions.</p><p> From this perspective, I think Greenhalgh&#39;s book should be mandatory reading for everyone. She outlines the right way to think about published research. As Richard Feynman once remarked, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” Knowing how to read a paper cannot substitute for years of study, but perhaps it can help you avoid fooling yourself.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Brain-New-Science-Read/dp/0143118056/">Reading in the Brain</a> by Stanislas Dehaene </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="668" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17076" style="width:157px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg 668w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-768x1178.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_.jpg 978w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></figure></div><p> A good complement to Willingham&#39;s <em>The Reading Mind</em> , this book, authored by one of the leading neuroscientists in his field, covers the neuroscientific perspective on reading.</p><p> It was from this book I learned the surprising fact that nearly all readers, in all languages, read in nearly the same way.

And what is the point of reading great literature? To be changed by it. To have the themes and descriptions give you tools for deciding how to live. This sort of explanation would have caused me to raise my eyebrows not too long ago. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to read philosophy, which directly tackles such questions, rather than an entertaining work that merely reaches them obliquely? The idea that someone could read <em>The Iliad</em> and derive from it a way of life borders upon the absurd. (The epic, you shall recall, begins with Achilles&#39; temper tantrum over the forfeiture of his war-won sex slave.)</p><p> Yet, I think Edmundson did a good job arguing his point. Stories are felt in ways that arguments are not. Reading <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> in my youth did more to shape my feelings about the idea of committing to a long and patient plan than any rational analysis about such an approach did.</p><p> Therefore, while I think direct instruction and books that plainly tackle one&#39;s questions are the best way to answer them, I think good literature and philosophy can help you ask better questions of your life in the first place. For that, they deserve a place in your library for more than mere entertainment.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> That&#39;s it for this month.

This is because each expert has a different subset of all available knowledge on a topic, so the average view is a better “best guess” than any individual&#39;s opinion.</li><li> The majority expert opinion may be wrong. But contrarian opinions are even more likely to be wrong. The value of this perspective is probabilistic: expert consensus will fail sometimes, but it fails less often than the contrarian alternative. It is therefore a strong default presumption to hold. </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17043" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> I forget exactly where I first heard this argument, but I find the logic difficult to reject. Experts are more accurate than non-experts. The expert consensus<span id='easy-footnote-4-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-17038' title="Or, if no consensus exists, then the viewpoint which would win a plurality of votes, were there to be an election."><sup>4</sup></a></span> is more accurate than any particular expert.</p><p> Despite the logic of this argument, the advice simply to believe the dominant scientific viewpoint on an issue has a lot of dissenters. Indeed, even though we could easily recognize its accuracy, if a viewpoint doesn&#39;t “feel” right, isn&#39;t it kind of brainless to just accept whatever some group of experts tells us to think? Shouldn&#39;t you make up your own mind and come to your own conclusions?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Objections to Simply Trusting Expertise</h2><p> There are many objections to the anti-contrarian epistemology I&#39;m supporting here, and I&#39;d like to review a few of them. While I do think some of these arguments can be legitimate, they need be invoked carefully. Successful contrarianism is like successful gambling—possible in theory, but it frequently leads to losing your shirt.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. “Experts ignore X.”</h3><p> The most common cry of the skeptic is that the experts ignore valuable evidence. In this view, because the expert opinion fails to sample some part of the useful knowledge needed to form an opinion, the conclusions aren&#39;t to be trusted. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17044" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> This is undoubtedly true, but I would argue it is a virtue rather than a vice. A lot of seeming evidence isn&#39;t reliable for forming conclusions, and simpler theories often lead to better explanations than ones that try to account for everything.</p><p> A physicist may assume an object is a perfectly rigid cube lying on a frictionless plane. A nutritionist may simplify foods into a collection of chemicals. An economist may assume people behave as rational utility-maximizing agents.</p><p> The omissions made by these models are not haphazard—experts themselves debate about which factors are important. Models and theories must necessarily be simpler than reality; a map as large as the territory it describes would be useless.</p><p> Claiming that a body of expertise is wrong because it systematically ignores some factor is simply a restatement of the contrarian claim that “factor X is important, but mainstream expert opinion says it isn&#39;t.” In other words, this argument doesn&#39;t work on its own. You&#39;d need an additional explanation for <em>why</em> experts ignore X, even though it is evidently important.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. “Experts are biased.”</h3><p> Although my rationale for believing experts is based on the idea that experts are simply smart people who know a lot about a topic, that isn&#39;t quite accurate. In reality, experts are social groups that carefully draw boundaries between members and non-members.</p><p> This social reality influences expertise, and anyone who has spent time with experts can attest to how much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_Life">social factors influence which beliefs take root</a> in expert communities.</p><p> If researchers are ideologically committed to a particular position, or they find certain conclusions of their research unpalatable for non-epistemic reasons, or even if they are disproportionately drawn from a group that is likely to hold strong prior beliefs, these can all be reasons to question expert conclusions. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17051" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> As an example, I find it difficult to wholeheartedly accept a lot of the science done by meditation or psychedelic researchers. These fields have a selection effect where many of the researchers begin with strong beliefs that those things ought to work, so there&#39;s a greater chance of finding false positive effects for the usual reasons science can go wrong.<span id='easy-footnote-5-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-17038' title="The opposite is also true: If people who have an ideological incentive to find a particular answer &lt;em>;struggle&lt;/em>; to find it, that’s probably strong evidence for a null conclusion. This was my takeaway on the research on cognitive training, which has had disappointing results despite being researched by many hopeful enthusiasts."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p><p> However, while bias is real and potentially a ground for legitimate contrarianism, we must also turn the mirror on ourselves. We, too, have biases that predispose us to be favorable to some perspectives rather than others. Casually discarding expert opinion because of bias is the pot calling the kettle black. If you&#39;re going to dismiss the majority opinion of a field because of bias, you need strong evidence that you yourself are more likely to be impartial—a high bar that few contrarians can surmount.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. “Those experts are fake.”</h3><p> Perhaps the biggest indictment of a field is simply to decry that the brand of expertise they practice is fake. If the knowledge the field has amassed is utter garbage, then there&#39;s no real reason for believing any of the claims it makes.</p><p> This claim is easiest to see with the benefit of hindsight. <em>Of course</em> scholastics who believed in Aristotle&#39;s four-elements theory of physics were fake. <em>Of course</em> doctors who used blood letting and leeches as cure-alls were fake. <em>Of course</em> alchemists, astrologers and fortune-tellers are fake. We see those fields, and the knowledge they accumulated, as largely worthless enterprises today—the average person would have been better off staying at home than visiting a doctor who would likely bleed them to death for a minor ailment. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17046" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> Of course, the idea that economics, theoretical physics, finance, nutrition, cognitive science or social psychology are fake fields with fake expertise is popular among contrarians of all stripes. After all, if you can reject the legitimacy of experts, you can discount their consensus opinions wholesale.</p><p> I&#39;m sympathetic to this claim. Like most people, I have my preferences for evidence and my hierarchy of fields I&#39;m willing to believe more strongly—and those I&#39;m more likely to roll my eyes at.</p><p> But, the argument for believing specific <em>claims</em> of expert opinion extends to believing in specific <em>fields</em> of expertise. Intellectual life doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. Different groups of experts all vie for supremacy on most topics—there are many questions that are simultaneously tackled by social psychologists, economists, anthropologists and humanities scholars. If an intellectual argument clearly “wins” in the court of opinion among intelligent observers, then that field gets a larger share of the intellectual marketplace and the less-successful intellectual group withers.</p><p> Indeed, the reason it&#39;s easier to point to past groups of experts as being clearly fake is because their paradigms did not survive the intellectual evolutionary process. Alchemy was outcompeted by chemistry. Aristotle&#39;s theory was outcompeted by Newton&#39;s. Modern evidence-based medicine outcompeted bloodletting and folk remedies.</p><p> In short, the rationale for accepting the legitimacy of a field are the same as the rationales for accepting a specific claim made within a field: If there were a better, more intellectually satisfying approach, the likelihood is that the better approach would dominate the current paradigm—from another community of experts if not from within.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. “Trusting experts is intellectually lazy. You should review the evidence and come to your own conclusions.”</h3><p> A final objection doesn&#39;t rest on the weakness of expert opinion, rather on the supposed intellectual vice that simply trusting experts creates. In this view, being the kind of person who follows along with the mainstream consensus is cowardly and lazy: you should bravely think for yourself—even if you sometimes get the wrong answer.</p><p> But this, to me, is a fundamental misconception. Trusting expertise is not an intellectually simple task. It takes enormous work to bring your worldview even partly in line with what experts think. Deep understanding requires you to review much of the knowledge that experts possess—hardly a task for the intellectually lazy. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17047" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> Instead, it&#39;s typically the reflexive contrarians who are intellectually lazy. They would prefer to read one flashy book that supports a worldview they are already predisposed to believe rather than wade through multiple dense textbooks that slowly build the consensus perspective.</p><p> Simply parroting the conclusions of experts is not enough. To really understand an expert conclusion, you need to develop for yourself the mental models used to generate it. That&#39;s hard work. It&#39;s why getting an advanced degree in a field takes so long—mastering the tools and models needed to accurately simulate the expert opinion in a wide range of scenarios within a single field takes years, and that must happen before the student can do their own meaningful work in that field.</p><p> Truly smart contrarianism not only has to articulate an opposing view, but provide a deep explanation for why that viewpoint is not widely accepted by other smart people with similar knowledge. Few experts in a given field ever reach this position, never mind casual readers commenting on a topic outside of their specialty.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Final, Moderating Factors</h2><p> My original advice was:</p><p> <strong>If you want to have more true beliefs, you should simply believe the experts who study the topic, most of the time.</strong></p><p> I would add a few moderating factors to that generalization:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Experts can tell you what to believe—not how strongly to believe it.</h3><p> The quality of evidence used to form expert beliefs varies widely. Despite this, experts, on the whole, are highly confident of their own opinions. Since making decisions in life depends on not only what the “best guess” beliefs are, but how likely they are to be correct, this lack of calibration is a problem for my simple model of trusting experts. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17048" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> I have much more faith in basic physics than basic nutrition, for instance. I would be extremely surprised if the principles of quantum mechanics turned out to be wrong, but it wouldn&#39;t shock me if nutritional researchers flip-flopped on the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/">link between saturated fat and heart disease</a> .</p><p> This lack of confidence calibration means that while it&#39;s not usually justified to say, “the experts are all wrong, you should believe X instead,” it&#39;s not always incorrect to say, “the experts are wrong, you shouldn&#39;t have <em>any</em> opinion on X.” Skepticism of the expert view in shaky fields is consistent with the position I&#39;m advocating for, even if true skepticism (rather than ardent belief in even more dubious propositions) is quite rare.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. If your goal isn&#39;t to maximize true beliefs, contrarianism can be justified.</h3><p> Somewhat ironically, the individual experts aren&#39;t necessarily incentivized to maximize the truth value of their beliefs. Expert consensus is a kind of smudgy, bland version of a particular worldview; it&#39;s what&#39;s left after averaging out of all sorts of unique or unusual perspectives. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17049" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> In contrast, a scientist or pundit aims not just to be right about the stuff everyone already agrees on, but to be <em>surprisingly</em> correct—to hold a belief that later turns out to be perceived as more plausible, thus changing the consensus viewpoint.</p><p> Indeed, this may even be a good thing. An intellectual environment where all experts followed my “just trust the experts” maxim would result in excessive conformity of opinion, making bias more likely. We should want to live in a world where experts don&#39;t agree, and instead debate each other, as this raises the average quality of their opinions.<span id='easy-footnote-6-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-17038' title="There is certainly a tension here with my advice. I recognize the value of believing experts, and I also recognize that if this is all I do, my work will probably fail to have much lasting intellectual value. I need to adopt at least a mild degree of contrarianism in my work, or I’ll risk being irrelevant."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p> An analogy is investing. The average investor is better off putting their money in a low-cost index fund rather than picking stocks. Most investors (including professionals) fail to beat the market consistently. And yet, we do want at least some amount of (mostly deluded) contrarians trying to actively beat the market, since it is this very activity that determines values in the market.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最后的想法</h2><p>While I first heard this argument for believing expertise ages ago, I don&#39;t think its logic alone is what made me attempt to follow it more rigorously in my life.</p><p> Instead, it&#39;s the experience of having been persuaded by a contrarian expert, being fully convinced and, years later, being dissuaded from those original views as I encountered more evidence. And unlike the boy who touched the fire, it took being burned more than a few times before I developed the reflex.</p><p> While I doubt this argument will bring any dyed-in-the-wool contrarians or conspiracy theorists to my worldview, I do hope it will nudge a few people into giving more weight to the dominant expert perspective, and a bit less weight to the voices of persuasive-sounding contrarians.</p><p> Because, ultimately, having true beliefs does matter. Your beliefs inform how you invest, eat, build your career, raise your kids and take care of your health. And if your fundamental worldview isn&#39;t optimized for gathering true beliefs, you&#39;re bound to make mistakes.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/">Just Trust the Experts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reading – Day One Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=17026 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m just beginning the fifth month of my year-long Foundations project.

It&#39;s also one that people do less frequently than they used to: most adults read fewer books than they did in decades past, no doubt a trend caused by the rise of smartphones.</p><p> However, reading books is something I&#39;m fairly good at. I&#39;ve regularly read at least 10 books for each month of this project so far, typically including at least two college-level textbooks for each topic. While my reading volume tends to go up and down depending on my projects, I can easily read a hundred books in a year when such reading is central to my work. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17029" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/10-Reading-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> Therefore, my personal goals for the month will be a little different than the habit I&#39;m encouraging other people to build this month, which is to always have a book. I&#39;ll touch on this general recommendation more at the end of this post, but otherwise I&#39;m focusing here on what I&#39;m doing in the month ahead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Two Goals: Bedtime Reading and Increased Breadth</h2><p> I have two goals for this month. The first is to get into a regular habit of reading before going to sleep. I do this sometimes, but not consistently. My hope here isn&#39;t to increase my reading volume, rather I want to use the habit to encourage better (and earlier) sleep.</p><p> I&#39;m not setting a minimum threshold for bedtime reading, since that would quickly become a burden if I stay up later than usual owing to social events. But I think having the habit of reading before sleep, even if only for a minute, will encourage me to wind down faster than looking at a screen.</p><p> My second goal for the month is to spend more time reading books outside of my usual non-fiction focus. While I enjoy literature and off-topic non-fiction books, they definitely take a back seat when I&#39;m working on a research project. I probably won&#39;t be able to sustain this breadth as I shift to future months, but I will use this month to plan some longer-term reading lists in areas I read less than I&#39;d like.</p><p> Here are some of the categories of books I&#39;d like to read more of:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Classic literature.</strong> Ever since reading Hirsch&#39;s book arguing for cultural literacy, I&#39;ve been encouraged to expand my reading with more classic works of fiction.</li><li> <strong>Religious works.</strong> I&#39;m not religious, but I think religion is a topic worth reading more of both for its cultural significance and its lessons for everyday life.</li><li><strong>历史。</strong> I&#39;ve read quite a few biographies, often while researching for my books, but I&#39;m less well-informed about a lot of history on its own. Given that history knowledge tends to be voluminous, I&#39;d like to make some efforts to expand here.</li><li> <strong>Books in other languages.</strong> I don&#39;t do nearly as much conversation practice in other languages as I used to; it was one of the necessary sacrifices I made to save time when I became a parent. But reading more in the languages I want to maintain is easier to fit in and something I&#39;d like to cultivate.</li></ol><p> I already have some books in each of these topics, probably more than enough for the month ahead, but I&#39;ll use this month to prepare some longer-term lists, so I&#39;ll have more books to choose from when those initial ideas run out.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> AHAB: Always Have A Book</h2><p> The keystone habit I&#39;m encouraging people in my <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> to cultivate for this month is simpler than my personal goals. It comes from the observation that a major obstacle to reading more is simply not having anything you&#39;re excited to read <em>right now</em> .</p><p> The practice to solve this can be summarized in a simple acronym AHAB, or “Always Have A Book.”</p><p> The goal is to have a book you&#39;re interested in reading with you at all times. This doesn&#39;t mean you need to lug around large paperbacks with you everywhere you go. With Kindle and Audible apps, you can now keep an entire library on your smartphone.</p><p> Setting this up means getting quite a few books—either buying them or borrowing them from a local library.</p><p> It also means prioritizing books you&#39;re keenly interested in reading. A common mistake people trying to read more make is trying to finish whatever boring book they&#39;ve already started. Then, because they don&#39;t actually want to read it, they spend more time on social media.</p><p> If you&#39;re already a voluminous reader, you can challenge yourself with harder books. But if you don&#39;t regularly read at least one book per month, I encourage you to build a habit of picking books you enjoy and not feeling even a twinge of guilt about failing to finish any book that no longer interests you.</p><p> I&#39;ve long practiced the AHAB habit, but even I slip occasionally. I&#39;ll have periods where I have a few paper books, but no Kindle books—which means I check the news on my phone rather than read. Or I don&#39;t have an audiobook I&#39;m listening to—which means I can&#39;t listen to anything other than music or podcasts even if I want to listen to a book.</p><p> Therefore, as part of my own challenge, I&#39;m aggressively stocking all of my go-to book places, so I have plenty of books ready at my office, nightstand, Kindle app and Audible.</p><p> As an aside, I&#39;m also hoping to use this month to relax a little bit in the project. The start of the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> , plus the research-heavy <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">food</a> and <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/">money</a> months, made my workload a little high over the previous two months. Since I&#39;ve spent the last several years of my life reading books about learning, my reading-about-reading book list will probably be a little lighter this month, and I&#39;ll use that downtime to read or listen to more off-topic books.</p><p> As always, I&#39;ll share how this focus went for me at the end of the month, as well as some of the books I enjoyed.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/">Reading – Day One Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Food – Month-End Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=17013 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m wrapping up the fourth month in my year-long foundations project.

Although I read a lot more and deepened my knowledge of many of the aspects of nutrition I was unclear on, behaviorally speaking, I was already pretty happy with my eating habits when this month began. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17015" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> My focus for the month, then, was on tracking my food intake. In particular, I was curious to see how my actual eating habits conformed to both dietary guidelines and my own subjective sense of how healthy I have been eating.</p><p> As an experiment, I found tracking my food intake for the month to be informative. In terms of nutritional information, I learned:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>I almost always get more than the minimum recommendation for fiber.</strong></li><li> <strong>I&#39;m typically under the threshold for saturated fat.</strong></li><li> <strong>I consume more sodium than I should.</strong> I&#39;m typically over, and this may be an undercount as my tracking might have missed some added salt in home-cooked dishes.</li><li> <strong>My protein intake is above the DRIs, but can be lower</strong> than what is considered optimal for strength training if I&#39;m not intentional about including it in every meal.</li></ol><p> I would have liked to learn more about micronutrients in my diet, but the software I used couldn&#39;t track these well. Too few foods reliably list things like omega-3 or other micronutrient content to really know whether my diet, which abstains from red meat, is low on zinc or iron, for instance.</p><p> In addition to nutritional information, I also got a lot of behavioral data:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> I tended to overconsume food when eating at restaurants or having guests over and cooking large dinners. When I cooked my own food and ate with my family, eating moderate portion sizes was pretty easy to do.</li><li> I don&#39;t drink often, but drinks caught me off guard for empty calories.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some of My Early Results</h2><p> Of course, most people don&#39;t track food intake to gain insight; they track to lose weight. I wasn&#39;t aiming to lose a lot of weight this month, but the app I used (MacroTracker) required it to set up the goals. Despite my ambivalence about sticking to the calories it recommended, I did end up adhering most of the time and lost about 4 lbs. from the start of the month.</p><p> While I mostly credit the fitness and dietary changes I started four months ago, rather than the specific efforts of this month, I&#39;m quite happy with my progress in my overall body composition. I&#39;m now around 165 lbs., down from a peak of around 178 lbs. shortly before the project started.</p><p> I haven&#39;t been consistent in measuring my waistline, but that has shifted too: it started around 37” sometime during the first month of the project and is around 33” now. Given I&#39;m in the “healthy” BMI range, I&#39;m going to pay more attention to this metric over the long-term, since muscle gains and losses will blur any effect of weight loss <em>per se</em> .</p><p> It&#39;s nice to be a bit leaner, closer to my college-era weight than I have been for the last several years, but I&#39;m also doing my best to not fixate on it. I&#39;m chastened by the pessimistic data on weight regain, so I&#39;d rather focus on sustaining health and fitness over the long-term.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why I&#39;m Not Tracking Long-Term</h2><p> While my experiment with tracking food was informative, it&#39;s not a behavior I want to sustain in the future. Tracking was annoying in the beginning, but now it&#39;s fairly well-automated as a habit, so I don&#39;t find the act of tracking to be the main problem. Instead, I think tracking what I ate had a few unwanted side effects that distracted me from how I&#39;d really like to eat:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Tracking encourages you to eat easy-to-track foods rather than healthy foods.</strong> While tracking discourages some poor food choices, such as junk food with a lot of calories, I find it also subtly encourages eating foods with nutritional labels, which ends up increasing processed foods rather than whole foods.</li><li> <strong>Tracking encourages a focus on calories (or macros) rather than other aspects of nutritional quality.</strong> This could be a side-effect of the app I was using, but I found that gamifying things like calorie count or grams of protein/fat/carbs encourages you to use that lens for viewing nutrition—but this approach wasn&#39;t really supported by my overall research. Such an emphasis encourages you to see whole wheat bread and white bread as being basically the same nutritionally, when they&#39;re really worlds apart.</li><li> <strong>Tracking encourages paying attention to numbers rather than internal sensations.</strong> The month of tracking gave me renewed appreciation for the more mindful way of eating I had been following the previous three months. When you focus on calories, you eat more when you have “room” and you hold back, even though you&#39;re hungry, when you&#39;re over. This may be good if you&#39;re struggling with overeating, but I found it discouraged me from listening to my own sensations of hunger and satiety, instead taking the app for ground truth.</li></ol><p> While the research on tracking tends to be fairly positive in terms of its overall effectiveness, for the sake of my diet long-term, I&#39;m going to focus on generally eating high nutritional quality food, being as physically active as possible and being mindful that I&#39;m eating enough—not too much or too little.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Food, Beyond Nutrition</h2><p> I&#39;m leaving this month feeling good about how I eat. One disappointment from the month was that the act of tracking preoccupied more of my time than anticipated, so I feel like the month ended up being more about <em>nutrition</em> (and less about other aspects of food) than I had initially intended. I had wanted to also focus on cooking more, exploring new recipes and finding more ways to make healthier eating more satisfying on a regular basis.</p><p> Now that I&#39;m taking a pause on tracking, I think I&#39;ll be able to resume some of these other aspirations, and I&#39;ll certainly get to revisit them when this essay gets published and I&#39;m working on this foundation along with everyone in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> .</p><p> Overall, I&#39;m satisfied with how this month went. I gained some insight into my eating habits, recommitted myself to the changes I started four months ago, and even managed to lose a few pounds.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Update on Fitness, Productivity and Money</h2><p> Some quick updates on my continued progress in the previous three foundations I covered:</p><p> For fitness, I continued to make major strides. I did two long runs of 21km, a half-marathon distance, and by far my longest runs ever. I can now do 9 pull-ups in a row, compared to 3 when I started. I&#39;m still below my peak strength on major lifts, but I&#39;m inching closer.</p><p> For productivity, I can&#39;t say that much has changed. I&#39;m better at tracking and coordinating a lot of non-work related tasks with my wife, but time is still limited, and staying on top of low-priority chores is still hard. I&#39;m accepting that there will always be more to do than time to do it in, and trying to feel good about what I am able to accomplish.</p><p> For money, I&#39;m actually a little behind with my monthly expense tracking. This was largely a side-effect of creating a new tracking template and thus needing to go through and relabel the past year of transactions before moving forward. Given I&#39;ve been tracking my expenses for nearly two decades already, I&#39;m not too concerned, but I&#39;m hoping to get caught up.</p><p> This month was also incredibly busy. Because I write these updates three months before we cover each topic in the class and they are published here, this was also (for me) the first month of the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> with the new students. I love teaching, but it definitely adds to my workload compared to just doing a solitary project. Additionally, my wife broke her foot which forced a reorganization of many of our day-to-day habits and childcare tasks.</p><p> Next month&#39;s focus will be on reading, a foundation I&#39;m already quite content with, so I&#39;m hoping it will act as a little bit of a breather on my end.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/">Food – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Four: How Life of Focus Works</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 25 Jan 2025 16:19:30 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16925 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> On Monday, Cal Newport and I are reopening Life of Focus for a new session.

Before we do that, I&#39;d like to take this chance to explain how Life of Focus works—since it is a little different from what most people have come to expect from online courses—and share how I think about designing courses to encourage behavior change.</p><p> The classic course is all about providing information. There&#39;s a syllabus with a list of content; a bunch of lectures where the ideas, facts and concepts are conveyed; and finally, there&#39;s an exam to test if you remember everything you were taught.</p><p> There&#39;s nothing wrong with this model for many subjects. In many fields, information is what&#39;s missing, so taking some time to learn is the best action.</p><p> However, from nearly two decades developing online courses, I&#39;ve often been disappointed with how the classic approach to structuring a course translates to action. The problem is that a lot of information, on its own, rarely translates to concrete behavioral change. A course on nutrition, for instance, will give you tons of useful concepts and ideas about eating better—but it may not actually change how you eat, which is the ultimate goal of most people.</p><p> When Cal Newport and I started designing Life of Focus, we knew this was going to be a potential issue in our course. Cal had recently published <em>Deep Work</em> and <em>Digital Minimalism</em> . Most of our prospective students had either read these books or followed Cal&#39;s blog or podcast and were already familiar with his calls for increasing focus in work and life.</p><p> We knew that people attending the course didn&#39;t need more exhortations to turn off their email when doing deep work or lessons about the neuroscience of attentional processing. Instead, we designed the course to guide them through specific steps to create new working behaviors, and to have follow-through so those behaviors could become lifelong habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Format of an Action-Centered Course</h2><p> As a result of this, Life of Focus (and my more recent course, Foundations) follows a different model than what we typically think of as a course.</p><p> To start, the course is organized into three monthly challenges. Rather than putting the lessons first with the homework as an optional bonus (let&#39;s face it, most people who take online courses rarely do the assignments), we put taking action to improve our focus first, and then provide regular lessons to remind and reinforce those actions as they are already underway.</p><p> The three challenges for Life of Focus are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Tracking your deep work hours</strong></li><li> <strong>Conducting a digital declutter, and</strong></li><li> <strong>Engaging in a focus-building project to make or learn something new.</strong></li></ul><p> As another inversion to the typical course format, we start each month with a guided worksheet. This helps students come up with step-by-step actions they can take to begin each month-long challenge with the best footing. Only once students start working on the challenge do we start providing lessons to fine-tune, remind, motivate and redirect students as they go through the month.</p><p> On top of this, we add a lot of direct community support and coaching so students can quickly address sticking points as they come up, before they fall off the challenge or get discouraged.</p><p> In brief, the format of Life of Focus is more like a personal trainer at the gym than a university class on exercise science. By encouraging action from the get-go, the lessons and feedback support behavioral changes as you&#39;re making them.</p><p> While Cal and I were unsure how such a novel course format would work with students, we have been pleasantly surprised, and many students have told us Life of Focus is their favorite course they&#39;ve taken with us. Many students have even taken the course multiple times since they first enrolled, treating second and third passes as a chance to further refine their process using the three-month structure it provides.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Life of Focus Opens Monday</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16945" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-768x415.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div><p> I wanted to explain this course format because, in running this course and others over the last few years, I&#39;ve forgotten how different this approach can be for many people. It can be hard to explain why joining a structured three-month program to improve focus is different than simply reading a book or listening to podcasts. But our focus on taking action first, and then supporting that action with learning, is designed to help our students make real changes—not just think about making them.</p><p> I hope you&#39;ll <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">join us</a> on Monday so you can see it for yourself!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/">Lesson Four: How Life of Focus Works</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Three: Why You Can&#39;t Focus</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:19:13 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16923 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Focus is hard.

And in the years since I&#39;ve started writing, it has gotten harder.</p><p> Diagnoses of ADHD (including self-diagnoses) have skyrocketed. While it&#39;s likely that some of this is due to a lessening of stigma around mental health issues revealing what was already there, anecdotally, it appears that people are having a much harder time concentrating than they used to.</p><p> The number of people I know who struggle to finish reading a single book, or who can&#39;t seem to stay on task for more than twenty minutes without opening their email, seems to be getting worse.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Are Smartphones Ruining Our Brains?</h2><p> While technology certainly plays a role in our collective distractibility, it&#39;s probably not the case that Google is literally making us stupider, or that we&#39;ve lost the ability to focus. I agree with cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham, who raises his eyebrows at the idea that our fundamental brain architecture could be reshaped in this way.</p><p> Instead, there&#39;s a much simpler explanation for why focus is hard—and why it has gotten harder. In short, the ability to sustain attention on something is a function of two factors:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>拉</strong>。<strong> </strong>This is how much an activity draws in and motivates us to sustain our attention. True multitasking is a myth, and our attention can only focus on one thing at a time. As a result, the pull of an activity is always defined <em>relative to everything else we could possibly be paying attention to at this moment.</em></li><li> <strong>Friction</strong> .<strong> </strong>This is how much resistance, difficulty or effort is required to sustain engagement in an activity. Too much friction, and even something that should be compelling is pushed out for easier alternatives. </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16936" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> These two factors help to explain why focusing has gotten so difficult lately. We&#39;re now in an environment where strong pulls on our attention are ubiquitous, so the relative pull for reading a great book is simply too quiet compared to the pull of social media or streaming television.</p><p> Second, many of our most potent distractions have become increasingly frictionless. When I started blogging two decades ago, reading my feeds meant going to the room with my computer (I still had a desktop), turning it on (which took forever), connecting to the internet, opening my RSS feed reader, and scrolling through an uncurated list of simple headlines to decide what to read.</p><p> Had I been born two decades later, I&#39;d instead have TikTok, which only requires taking a device out of my pocket, with whatever content *it* deems most interesting served up to me instantaneously.</p><p> “Dumb” media and old-fashioned hobbies, which haven&#39;t altered much, have the same pull and friction that they&#39;ve always had. But they can&#39;t compete with the attentional candy we now encounter regularly.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How to Improve Your Ability to Focus</h2><p> This two-part model of focus suggests a simple answer for how you can focus better: increase the relative pull of an activity, reduce the friction, or both. And since pull and friction are defined relative to all salient alternatives, you can achieve the same impact by reducing the pull or increasing the friction of your most tempting distractions.</p><p> Let&#39;s consider all four possibilities:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Increase the pull of focusing</strong> . Read more interesting books. Choose hobbies you find compelling. Join groups to integrate socializing with activities you enjoy. Measure your progress and give yourself rewards just for showing up.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the friction of focusing</strong> . Have books always available. Have your hobbies “ready-to-go” rather than requiring lengthy setup. Stop reading books that bore you (read something else instead). Make it possible to quickly dip into the things you care about.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the pull of distractions</strong> . Put your phone on grayscale. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">Switch your media consumption to RSS feeds</a> , rather than algorithmically curated sources.</li><li> <strong>Increase the friction of distractions</strong> . Keep your phone in a dedicated location in your house, rather than at your hip. Delete apps from your phone, so you need to log in with your computer.</li></ol><p> A similar fourfold list of strategies can be employed for improving your focused work, not just your focused leisure: Increase the pull of deep work, decrease the pull of shallow work, decrease the friction of deep work, increase the friction of shallow work.</p><p> Shifting to a more focused life takes time and work. None of these changes are automatic, and it can take awhile for them to feel natural. But if you invest in a more focused life now, you can reap dividends for all your years to come. With sufficient time, these habits will become automatic and, sure enough, you&#39;ll find yourself reading more books, engaging in more interesting hobbies and completing more meaningful projects.</p><p> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my course co-taught with Cal Newport, will begin on Monday, January 27th. If you&#39;re interested in joining, I will be sending out registration information on Monday. I look forward to working with a dedicated group of students to help them improve their focus and achieve bigger things in 2025!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/">Lesson Three: Why You Can&#39;t Focus</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Two: More Craft, Less Chores</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:18:53 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16921 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;ve always struggled with the idea of work-life balance.

What if I had to read the book for research? What&#39;s different between the drawings I do for fun and those I use on this blog?</p><p> Perhaps I&#39;m an isolated case, but I&#39;d like to think not. In the years Cal Newport and I have run <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , I&#39;ve interacted with dozens of students who struggle with work and play being intermixed in both their time at home and their time formally allocated to an employer.</p><p> The situation is even more complicated for retirees, students, academics, and stay-at-home parents, many of whom aren&#39;t “paid,” strictly speaking, for many things that clearly seem to be work.</p><p> Recently, however, I&#39;ve stumbled into a distinction I think matters more than the one between work and life: that between craft and chores. While work seemingly embodies everything you must do to earn a living, and life is everything else, craft is all of the productive activities that utilize your creativity and skill in order to accomplish something you&#39;re proud of, and chores are all the tasks that must be done to keep on going but don&#39;t satisfy this same desire.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Maximize Craft Instead of Balancing Work</h2><p> One thing I like about this revised approach is that it shifts the goals for our productive lives.</p><p> Working nonstop is not desirable. Burnout is real, and even if you love your job, pressure to perform continuously can be exhausting. If you add to that all the commitments you have outside of work, even a dream job can become a millstone around your neck if you aren&#39;t careful.</p><p> Yet “balance” is definitionally hard to achieve.</p><p> Balance is akin to Aristotle&#39;s maxim that virtue is to be found in moderation—except everyone&#39;s definition of moderation is different. What&#39;s a moderate amount of eating?喝？ Going to the office? We end up falling back on cultural norms, where 9 to 5 is considered “balanced” even though a full-time job can be exhausting if you also have full-time childcare duties. And different cultures may have entirely different standards, in fact China&#39;s infamous 9-9-6 start-up culture was sold as being *more* balanced than the nonstop-work ethic promoted at more aggressive firms.</p><p> In general, it&#39;s easier to optimize a dimension of life by maximizing for something than by balancing between two extremes.</p><p> Given this, I prefer the idea of maximizing craft and minimizing chores across *both* my working life and personal life. I&#39;d like to write more essays and spend less time filing taxes in my work, just as I&#39;d like to finish more paintings and spend less time doing dishes at home. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16934" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Do You Maximize Craft?</h2><p> Definitions are nice, but how do you actually do this? Clearly, there will always be unavoidable chores both at work and at home. Spending more time on craft, while nice-sounding, can be hard to achieve in practice.</p><p> I believe the answer comes down to focus. In your work, if you can carve out regular chunks of time for deep work, you&#39;ll start automatically shifting your work toward the dimension of “craft” and away from “chores.” In the beginning, that shift might come from simply being more efficient with the chores, even if their quantity hasn&#39;t diminished. But, eventually, as you build “craft” accomplishments, it becomes easier to delegate and avoid chores in favor of more time spent on your craft.</p><p> We tend to specialize at what we regularly do, and if you spend your time on deep work, it creates a gravitational pull towards more deep work. Likewise, getting really good at chores makes you the person who gets assigned more chores.</p><p> At home, things are not quite as simple. Short of hiring an army of help, many chores will need to be done. But here, too, steps to maximize craft often succeed by squeezing out the hours spent on activities that are neither necessary chores nor meaningful crafts—the filler time spent endlessly scrolling on our phones or watching television shows we don&#39;t even enjoy.</p><p> In the previous lesson, I argued that this year should be a year for doing something big—actually finishing a project you&#39;ve had in mind for some time. Now, I&#39;d like to encourage you to go further, to think about maximizing the feeling of craft throughout your life. Doing activities that require full engagement, genuine skill and give you a feeling of satisfaction when they&#39;re completed.</p><p> In the next lesson, I&#39;ll share a simple model for how to think about focus. In particular, what you can do to overcome some of your own internal resistance to maximizing craft and achieving big things.
