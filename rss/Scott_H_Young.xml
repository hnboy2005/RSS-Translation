有许多问题由社会心理学家，经济学家，人类学家和人文学者同时解决。如果智力观察者在意见法院中明显“胜利”，那么这个领域就会在知识分裂市场和不成功的知识群体中占有更大的份额。</p><p>的确，要更容易将过去的专家群体视为显然是伪造的原因是因为他们的范式无法在智力进化过程中幸存下来。炼金术被化学胜过。亚里士多德的理论被牛顿的理论所吸引。现代循证医学胜任血液和民间疗法。</p><p>简而言之，接受领域的合法性的基本原理与接受在领域内提出的特定主张的理由相同：如果有更好，更智力地令人满意的方法，那么更好的方法是更好的方法将主导当前的当前范式 -

购买或从当地图书馆借用它们。</p><p>这也意味着优先考虑您对阅读感兴趣的书籍。人们试图阅读更多赚钱的常见错误是试图完成他们已经开始的任何无聊的书。然后，由于他们实际上不想阅读它，所以他们在社交媒体上花费更多的时间。</p><p>如果您已经是读者，那么您可以用更艰难的书籍来挑战自己。但是，如果您每月至少不定期阅读一本书，我鼓励您养成挑选自己喜欢的书的习惯，甚至没有对未能完成任何不再感兴趣的书感到内gui。</p><p>我长期以来一直练习Ahab的习惯，但即使我偶尔会滑倒。我将有几本纸质书籍，但没有Kindle书籍，这意味着我在手机上检查了新闻，而不是阅读。或者我没有听听的有声读物，这意味着即使我想听一本书，我也无法听音乐或播客。</p><p>因此，作为我自己挑战的一部分，我正在积极地库存所有的书籍，所以我在办公室，床头柜，Kindle应用程序和Audible上准备了很多书。</p><p>顺便说一句，我也希望本月能在项目中放松一下。<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基金会课程</a>的开始，加上研究丰富的<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">食物</a>和<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/">金钱的</a>月份，使我的工作量在过去两个月中略高一些。自从我一生的最后几年阅读有关学习的书籍以来，我的阅读书清单本月可能会有些轻一些，我将使用这种停机时间来阅读或听更多的偏离题为图书。</p><p>与往常一样，我将分享这个重点在本月底以及我喜欢的一些书。</p><p>帖子<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/11/reading-open/">阅读 -

不是太多或太少了。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">食物，超越营养</h2><p>我本月要离开我的饮食感到满意。这个月的一个失望是，跟踪的行为比我预期的更多的时间全神贯注，所以我觉得这个月最终比我最初预期的要多于<em>营养</em>（而不是食物的其他方面）。我还想专注于烹饪，探索新食谱并找到更多的方法，以使更健康的饮食定期更令人满意。</p><p>既然我正在暂停跟踪，我认为我将能够恢复其中的其他一些愿望，当本文发表本文时，我一定会重新审视它们<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基础课程</a>中的每个人。</p><p>总的来说，我对这个月的表现感到满意。我对自己的饮食习惯有所了解，建议自己参加四个月前开始的变化，甚至设法减掉了几磅。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">健身，生产力和金钱的更新</h2><p>关于我在前三个基础上的持续进展的快速更新：</p><p>为了健身，我继续取得了长足的进步。我做了两次长达21公里的长跑，半程马拉松比赛，到目前为止，我有史以来最长的跑步。现在，我可以连续进行9次上拉，而我开始进行3次上拉。我仍然低于重大升降机的峰值强度，但是我靠近了。</p><p>为了生产力，我不能说发生了很大变化。我更好地与我的妻子跟踪和协调许多与工作相关的任务，但是时间仍然有限，并且仍然很难保持低优先的琐事。 I&#39;m accepting that there will always be more to do than time to do it in, and trying to feel good about what I am able to accomplish.</p><p> For money, I&#39;m actually a little behind with my monthly expense tracking. This was largely a side-effect of creating a new tracking template and thus needing to go through and relabel the past year of transactions before moving forward. Given I&#39;ve been tracking my expenses for nearly two decades already, I&#39;m not too concerned, but I&#39;m hoping to get caught up.</p><p> This month was also incredibly busy. Because I write these updates three months before we cover each topic in the class and they are published here, this was also (for me) the first month of the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> with the new students. I love teaching, but it definitely adds to my workload compared to just doing a solitary project. Additionally, my wife broke her foot which forced a reorganization of many of our day-to-day habits and childcare tasks.</p><p> Next month&#39;s focus will be on reading, a foundation I&#39;m already quite content with, so I&#39;m hoping it will act as a little bit of a breather on my end.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/">Food – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/04/food-month-end-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Four: How Life of Focus Works</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 25 Jan 2025 16:19:30 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16925 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> On Monday, Cal Newport and I are reopening Life of Focus for a new session.

Before we do that, I&#39;d like to take this chance to explain how Life of Focus works—since it is a little different from what most people have come to expect from online courses—and share how I think about designing courses to encourage behavior改变。</p><p> The classic course is all about providing information. There&#39;s a syllabus with a list of content; a bunch of lectures where the ideas, facts and concepts are conveyed; and finally, there&#39;s an exam to test if you remember everything you were taught.</p><p> There&#39;s nothing wrong with this model for many subjects. In many fields, information is what&#39;s missing, so taking some time to learn is the best action.</p><p> However, from nearly two decades developing online courses, I&#39;ve often been disappointed with how the classic approach to structuring a course translates to action. The problem is that a lot of information, on its own, rarely translates to concrete behavioral change. A course on nutrition, for instance, will give you tons of useful concepts and ideas about eating better—but it may not actually change how you eat, which is the ultimate goal of most people.</p><p> When Cal Newport and I started designing Life of Focus, we knew this was going to be a potential issue in our course. Cal had recently published <em>Deep Work</em> and <em>Digital Minimalism</em> . Most of our prospective students had either read these books or followed Cal&#39;s blog or podcast and were already familiar with his calls for increasing focus in work and life.</p><p> We knew that people attending the course didn&#39;t need more exhortations to turn off their email when doing deep work or lessons about the neuroscience of attentional processing. Instead, we designed the course to guide them through specific steps to create new working behaviors, and to have follow-through so those behaviors could become lifelong habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Format of an Action-Centered Course</h2><p> As a result of this, Life of Focus (and my more recent course, Foundations) follows a different model than what we typically think of as a course.</p><p> To start, the course is organized into three monthly challenges. Rather than putting the lessons first with the homework as an optional bonus (let&#39;s face it, most people who take online courses rarely do the assignments), we put taking action to improve our focus first, and then provide regular lessons to remind and reinforce those actions as they are already underway.</p><p> The three challenges for Life of Focus are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Tracking your deep work hours</strong></li><li> <strong>Conducting a digital declutter, and</strong></li><li> <strong>Engaging in a focus-building project to make or learn something new.</strong></li></ul><p> As another inversion to the typical course format, we start each month with a guided worksheet. This helps students come up with step-by-step actions they can take to begin each month-long challenge with the best footing. Only once students start working on the challenge do we start providing lessons to fine-tune, remind, motivate and redirect students as they go through the month.</p><p> On top of this, we add a lot of direct community support and coaching so students can quickly address sticking points as they come up, before they fall off the challenge or get discouraged.</p><p> In brief, the format of Life of Focus is more like a personal trainer at the gym than a university class on exercise science. By encouraging action from the get-go, the lessons and feedback support behavioral changes as you&#39;re making them.</p><p> While Cal and I were unsure how such a novel course format would work with students, we have been pleasantly surprised, and many students have told us Life of Focus is their favorite course they&#39;ve taken with us. Many students have even taken the course multiple times since they first enrolled, treating second and third passes as a chance to further refine their process using the three-month structure it provides.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Life of Focus Opens Monday</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16945" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/imagine-768x415.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div><p> I wanted to explain this course format because, in running this course and others over the last few years, I&#39;ve forgotten how different this approach can be for many people. It can be hard to explain why joining a structured three-month program to improve focus is different than simply reading a book or listening to podcasts. But our focus on taking action first, and then supporting that action with learning, is designed to help our students make real changes—not just think about making them.</p><p> I hope you&#39;ll <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">join us</a> on Monday so you can see it for yourself!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/">Lesson Four: How Life of Focus Works</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/25/how-life-of-focus-works/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Three: Why You Can&#39;t Focus</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:19:13 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16923 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Focus is hard.

And in the years since I&#39;ve started writing, it has gotten harder.</p><p> Diagnoses of ADHD (including self-diagnoses) have skyrocketed. While it&#39;s likely that some of this is due to a lessening of stigma around mental health issues revealing what was already there, anecdotally, it appears that people are having a much harder time concentrating than they used to.</p><p> The number of people I know who struggle to finish reading a single book, or who can&#39;t seem to stay on task for more than twenty minutes without opening their email, seems to be getting worse.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Are Smartphones Ruining Our Brains?</h2><p> While technology certainly plays a role in our collective distractibility, it&#39;s probably not the case that Google is literally making us stupider, or that we&#39;ve lost the ability to focus. I agree with cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham, who raises his eyebrows at the idea that our fundamental brain architecture could be reshaped in this way.</p><p> Instead, there&#39;s a much simpler explanation for why focus is hard—and why it has gotten harder. In short, the ability to sustain attention on something is a function of two factors:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>拉</strong>。<strong> </strong>This is how much an activity draws in and motivates us to sustain our attention. True multitasking is a myth, and our attention can only focus on one thing at a time. As a result, the pull of an activity is always defined <em>relative to everything else we could possibly be paying attention to at this moment.</em></li><li><strong>摩擦</strong>。<strong> </strong>This is how much resistance, difficulty or effort is required to sustain engagement in an activity. Too much friction, and even something that should be compelling is pushed out for easier alternatives. </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16936" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> These two factors help to explain why focusing has gotten so difficult lately. We&#39;re now in an environment where strong pulls on our attention are ubiquitous, so the relative pull for reading a great book is simply too quiet compared to the pull of social media or streaming television.</p><p> Second, many of our most potent distractions have become increasingly frictionless. When I started blogging two decades ago, reading my feeds meant going to the room with my computer (I still had a desktop), turning it on (which took forever), connecting to the internet, opening my RSS feed reader, and scrolling through an uncurated list of simple headlines to decide what to read.</p><p> Had I been born two decades later, I&#39;d instead have TikTok, which only requires taking a device out of my pocket, with whatever content *it* deems most interesting served up to me instantaneously.</p><p> “Dumb” media and old-fashioned hobbies, which haven&#39;t altered much, have the same pull and friction that they&#39;ve always had. But they can&#39;t compete with the attentional candy we now encounter regularly.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How to Improve Your Ability to Focus</h2><p> This two-part model of focus suggests a simple answer for how you can focus better: increase the relative pull of an activity, reduce the friction, or both. And since pull and friction are defined relative to all salient alternatives, you can achieve the same impact by reducing the pull or increasing the friction of your most tempting distractions.</p><p> Let&#39;s consider all four possibilities:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Increase the pull of focusing</strong> . Read more interesting books. Choose hobbies you find compelling. Join groups to integrate socializing with activities you enjoy. Measure your progress and give yourself rewards just for showing up.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the friction of focusing</strong> . Have books always available. Have your hobbies “ready-to-go” rather than requiring lengthy setup. Stop reading books that bore you (read something else instead). Make it possible to quickly dip into the things you care about.</li><li> <strong>Decrease the pull of distractions</strong> . Put your phone on grayscale. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">Switch your media consumption to RSS feeds</a> , rather than algorithmically curated sources.</li><li> <strong>Increase the friction of distractions</strong> . Keep your phone in a dedicated location in your house, rather than at your hip. Delete apps from your phone, so you need to log in with your computer.</li></ol><p> A similar fourfold list of strategies can be employed for improving your focused work, not just your focused leisure: Increase the pull of deep work, decrease the pull of shallow work, decrease the friction of deep work, increase the friction of shallow work.</p><p> Shifting to a more focused life takes time and work. None of these changes are automatic, and it can take awhile for them to feel natural. But if you invest in a more focused life now, you can reap dividends for all your years to come. With sufficient time, these habits will become automatic and, sure enough, you&#39;ll find yourself reading more books, engaging in more interesting hobbies and completing more meaningful projects.</p><p> <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my course co-taught with Cal Newport, will begin on Monday, January 27th. If you&#39;re interested in joining, I will be sending out registration information on Monday. I look forward to working with a dedicated group of students to help them improve their focus and achieve bigger things in 2025!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/">Lesson Three: Why You Can&#39;t Focus</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/23/why-you-cant-focus/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson Two: More Craft, Less Chores</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:18:53 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16921 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;ve always struggled with the idea of work-life balance.

What counts as “work” and what counts as “leisure” is harder to separate when I make my own schedule and don&#39;t get paid by the hour. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16933" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Work-life-balance-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> For instance, when I read a book that really interests me and then write about it later—was the reading work or fun? What if I had to read the book for research? What&#39;s different between the drawings I do for fun and those I use on this blog?</p><p> Perhaps I&#39;m an isolated case, but I&#39;d like to think not. In the years Cal Newport and I have run <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , I&#39;ve interacted with dozens of students who struggle with work and play being intermixed in both their time at home and their time formally allocated to an employer.</p><p> The situation is even more complicated for retirees, students, academics, and stay-at-home parents, many of whom aren&#39;t “paid,” strictly speaking, for many things that clearly seem to be work.</p><p> Recently, however, I&#39;ve stumbled into a distinction I think matters more than the one between work and life: that between craft and chores. While work seemingly embodies everything you must do to earn a living, and life is everything else, craft is all of the productive activities that utilize your creativity and skill in order to accomplish something you&#39;re proud of, and chores are all the tasks that must be done to keep on going but don&#39;t satisfy this same desire.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Maximize Craft Instead of Balancing Work</h2><p> One thing I like about this revised approach is that it shifts the goals for our productive lives.</p><p> Working nonstop is not desirable. Burnout is real, and even if you love your job, pressure to perform continuously can be exhausting. If you add to that all the commitments you have outside of work, even a dream job can become a millstone around your neck if you aren&#39;t careful.</p><p> Yet “balance” is definitionally hard to achieve.</p><p> Balance is akin to Aristotle&#39;s maxim that virtue is to be found in moderation—except everyone&#39;s definition of moderation is different. What&#39;s a moderate amount of eating?喝？去办公室？ We end up falling back on cultural norms, where 9 to 5 is considered “balanced” even though a full-time job can be exhausting if you also have full-time childcare duties. And different cultures may have entirely different standards, in fact China&#39;s infamous 9-9-6 start-up culture was sold as being *more* balanced than the nonstop-work ethic promoted at more aggressive firms.</p><p> In general, it&#39;s easier to optimize a dimension of life by maximizing for something than by balancing between two extremes.</p><p> Given this, I prefer the idea of maximizing craft and minimizing chores across *both* my working life and personal life. I&#39;d like to write more essays and spend less time filing taxes in my work, just as I&#39;d like to finish more paintings and spend less time doing dishes at home. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16934" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Craft-Chores-optimization-vs-Work-Life-balance-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Do You Maximize Craft?</h2><p> Definitions are nice, but how do you actually do this? Clearly, there will always be unavoidable chores both at work and at home. Spending more time on craft, while nice-sounding, can be hard to achieve in practice.</p><p> I believe the answer comes down to focus. In your work, if you can carve out regular chunks of time for deep work, you&#39;ll start automatically shifting your work toward the dimension of “craft” and away from “chores.” In the beginning, that shift might come from simply being more efficient with the chores, even if their quantity hasn&#39;t diminished. But, eventually, as you build “craft” accomplishments, it becomes easier to delegate and avoid chores in favor of more time spent on your craft.</p><p> We tend to specialize at what we regularly do, and if you spend your time on deep work, it creates a gravitational pull towards more deep work. Likewise, getting really good at chores makes you the person who gets assigned more chores.</p><p> At home, things are not quite as simple. Short of hiring an army of help, many chores will need to be done. But here, too, steps to maximize craft often succeed by squeezing out the hours spent on activities that are neither necessary chores nor meaningful crafts—the filler time spent endlessly scrolling on our phones or watching television shows we don&#39;t even enjoy.</p><p> In the previous lesson, I argued that this year should be a year for doing something big—actually finishing a project you&#39;ve had in mind for some time. Now, I&#39;d like to encourage you to go further, to think about maximizing the feeling of craft throughout your life. Doing activities that require full engagement, genuine skill and give you a feeling of satisfaction when they&#39;re completed.</p><p> In the next lesson, I&#39;ll share a simple model for how to think about focus. In particular, what you can do to overcome some of your own internal resistance to maximizing craft and achieving big things. And on Monday, January 27th, I&#39;ll reopen <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my three-month course co-taught by Cal Newport.敬请关注！</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/">Lesson Two: More Craft, Less Chores</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/21/more-craft-less-chores/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Lesson One: Do Something Big This Year</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16919 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Cal Newport and I are opening our Life of Focus course for a new session next week.

I think you should, too.</p><p> Projects exist in the middle space of our productive activities. At one end we have tasks, the myriad things that need doing in our day-to-day lives: filing taxes, walking the dog, doing laundry, submitting that report. At the other end are our grand dreams for our lives: to be financially independent, travel the world, build a business or raise successful kids.</p><p> Grand dreams are nice, but they&#39;re generally not very practical. It&#39;s easy to get excited as you think them over, but rarely does even the most compelling grand dream tell you what, precisely, you should be doing on Tuesday morning to make it come true. Their size and distance makes them poor objects for sustaining motivation.</p><p> Tasks and to-do lists suffer from the opposite problem. You can check off lots of tasks while accomplishing nothing major. Sure, the house is a little cleaner, maybe you&#39;ve balanced your chequebook and fixed the wobbly chair in the dining room, but these, like most tasks, simply sustain your current life. They don&#39;t take you somewhere new.</p><p> Projects act as the bridge between grand dreams and daily action. A big life goal often can be achieved in a project or two. And a project can be achieved through a coordinated series of tasks. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16931" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Mindset Needed to Habitually Complete Projects</h2><p> Being good at completing projects requires a different mindset than being merely productive (and thus being good at checking off tasks) or ambitious (and thus coming up with grand visions for your life).</p><p> Completing projects requires focus. Focus is not just the ability to sit down and work at something hard for hours at a time; it&#39;s also learning how to ignore all the other things screaming for your attention. Sometimes those other things are entertainment or distractions. More often, they&#39;re legitimate tasks and work that, if you heed their siren song, will have you crashing against the rocky shore of minutiae long before you reach your ambitious destination.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> It&#39;s Time to Finish What You Start</h2><p> My guess is that you already have some project ideas. Perhaps some you&#39;ve idly thought about. Perhaps some you&#39;ve already committed to. Perhaps some that oscillate between daydreams and serious efforts.</p><p> This year, I suggest you go ahead and finish one of them. It doesn&#39;t need to be the largest or most difficult project on your list—but it should be something that matters to you. Make this the year that you don&#39;t just *think* about doing it, but actually finish it.</p><p> Certainly, this is easier said than done. Perhaps you have dreamt up projects that have gone nowhere. Maybe you&#39;ve even insisted that “this time it&#39;s different,” and you&#39;re finally going to complete a project you&#39;ve been thinking about for years—only to succumb to the relentless tide of distractions in the months ahead.</p><p>我们都去过那里。</p><p> If you are looking for help with this, I encourage you to join the upcoming session of our course, Life of Focus. In it, we&#39;ll help you set and achieve a consistent deep work target—a necessity for making sustained progress. We&#39;ll declutter your leisure time—creating space to tackle big things. And we&#39;ll cultivate your ability to sustain your attention in the way, and on the things, you choose.</p><p> The full three-month course is a great complement to any big goal you&#39;ve been meaning to accomplish, but I want to leave you with one strategy you can apply today: right now, start tracking the hours you spend working on the project you have in mind.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t require fancy software or complicated calculations. A simple piece of paper where you tally every uninterrupted hour of work towards your project will suffice.</p><p> Put the tally on your wall, on your phone, or anywhere you will look at it often. By maintaining a visual reminder of your decision to focus, you can steadily move in the right direction.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p> <em><a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my three-month course co-taught with Cal Newport, will reopen for a new session on Monday, January 27, 2025.</em></p></blockquote><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/">Lesson One: Do Something Big This Year</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 14 Jan 2025 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16963 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Looking to eat better?

I’m working three months ahead of the Foundations &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/&quot;>;course&lt;/a>; and articles published here to make sure I have time to finish my research before I write course content. I decided to publish this one a little in advance because we’ll be holding a new session of Life of Focus in just over a week."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus is on food.</p><p> Part of my goal for each month is to read as much as I can about each topic, both for my own knowledge and to try to summarize the essential expert recommendations for those participating in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">course</a> .</p><p> Food is a particularly tricky subject. Nutritional science is complicated—and often conflicting. Popular media on this topic is a cesspool of misinformation, hype, and some downright dangerous advice being presented as the road to good health.</p><p> Still, I wanted to do my best to get it right. Given my complete lack of credentials in this area, that meant focusing my reading more on textbooks (I read two, each 800+ pages), popular books noted for their scientific accuracy (I read three specifically for their high ratings from the non-profit <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/">Red Pen Reviews</a> ), and those written by scholars I respect. I also made heavy use of the podcast <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/">Sigma Nutrition</a> , which presents academic discussions of nutritional research.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16963' title="I wouldn’t normally recommend a podcast in place of a scholarly reference source, but I found the detailed discussions of nutritional research to be much more nuanced than most other sources, including textbooks, I found elsewhere."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p> I can&#39;t say for sure that I got it all right. But after having read a few thousand pages and listened to many hours of scientific discussions, I suspect that much of the residual confusion I have is likely embedded in the field itself rather than a simple misunderstanding on my part.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The 3-Minute Summary of What I Learned (and Unlearned)</h2><p> In terms of concision, it&#39;s hard to beat Michael Pollan&#39;s overall eating advice:</p><p class="has-text-align-left"> <strong>“Eat food.不多。 Mostly plants.”</strong></p><p> Despite the complexity and contention of the underlying research, most advice for eating well is pretty basic: </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> Eat more whole foods.</li><li>多吃水果和蔬菜。</li><li> Eat more fiber.</li><li> Eat a range of different food types and foods within each type.</li><li>多吃全谷物。</li><li> Go easy on the refined grains, added sugars, processed meat and saturated fat.</li></ul></blockquote><p> A seventh recommendation, though not universally agreed to, might be “Try to eat a bit more protein, particularly from plant and marine sources.”</p><p> But, in addition to these fairly uncontroversial ideas, I also found some repeated ideas that surprised me somewhat:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Egg yolks aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Dietary cholesterol has a pretty minimal effect on blood cholesterol. Egg yolks famously have a lot of cholesterol, so they were unnecessarily vilified.</li><li> <strong>Too much saturated fat is still bad for you.</strong> Trans fats are worse, of course, but most sources recommend swapping solid fats in your diet, like lard and butter, for healthy oils to reduce the risk of heart disease.</li><li> <strong>Carbs aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Carbs have replaced fat as the dietary villain of our age, but carbs are the body&#39;s preferred energy source. Unrefined grains and carbs from fruit and vegetables are a boon for health.</li><li> <strong>Most additives in food are safe.</strong> Whole foods are good, of course, but the belief that small amounts of preservatives or chemical food additives are the source of ill health seems largely unfounded. Processing strips nutrients and reformulates foods to make them easier to overconsume, but the additives themselves are largely harmless.</li><li> <strong>Coffee and chocolate are healthy.</strong> In moderation, coffee appears to be a net positive for health. Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, seems to be good as well. Chocolate has a lot of calories, so it&#39;s easy to overconsume, but the type of saturated fat present in cacao isn&#39;t harmful.</li></ol><p> Despite this, there are still some controversies I couldn&#39;t find a straight answer on. It&#39;s still unclear to me whether whole milk or low-fat milk is better for health.<span id='easy-footnote-8-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-16963' title="Textbooks advocate for more milk consumption, but choosing low-fat varieties. Walter Willett advocates for less milk in general.

However, the textbooks note that this is perhaps a greater worry for those who are particularly sensitive to sodium’s effects. Given the difficulty of getting sodium intake to within dietary prescriptions, I wasn’t sure whether it was an area that needed improvement if I have normal blood pressure."><sup>9</sup></a></span> Obesity is also a major driver of diet-related illness, so it&#39;s not clear to me whether the recommended dietary interventions promote health by reducing your chances of gaining weight, or by being generally good for lean people.<span id='easy-footnote-10-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-16963' title="For instance, I encountered some research suggesting that even added sugars, the villain du jour of popular dietary advice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigmanutrition.com/episode468/&quot;>;may not actually be harmful&lt;/a>; if they don’t lead to caloric excess. In contrast, the prescription to avoid processed red meats seems to be related to the risk of colon cancer, independent of effects on weight. For other recommendations, this distinction was less clear."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Brief Notes on the 10 Books I Read</h2><p> My favorite book of the month was Walter Willett&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">Eat, Drink and Be Healthy</a> . Not only is it the most highly-rated book in terms of scientific accuracy and healthfulness on Red Pen Reviews, but Willett is the world&#39;s most-cited nutritional researcher.</p><p> The most engaging/fun read of the month was a re-read, Michael Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> . His high-level recommendations on eating are difficult to fault, and there is much to say in favor of his philosophy of common-sense nutrition. I disagree with Pollan on some research he cites, but I feel like you&#39;d hardly be led astray if you stick with his practical takeaways.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s look at some notes from each book:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</a> by Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16968" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Co-developed by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, this book is perhaps the most scientifically reputable, popular diet book available today. Willett, whose work on the Nurses&#39; Health Study made him one of the world&#39;s most-esteemed nutritional epidemiologists, provides his perspective on what science says we should eat to be healthy.</p><p> Most of the recommendations fit within the Mediterranean diet pattern—so-called because the famous Seven Countries Study found that inhabitants of Crete had much lower rates of heart disease, owing to their eating whole grains, lots of vegetables and seafood, little red meat and plenty of olive oil.</p><p> Despite its impeccable credentials, this book does depart in some ways from some of my other reading on nutrition. Willett continues to recommend moderate alcohol consumption for health, something that more recent data seem to be undermining.<span id='easy-footnote-11-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-16963' title="For clarification, it&amp;#8217;s long been known that excessive alcohol consumption is bad for you. But until recently, it was believed that moderate consumption (e.g., 1-2 glasses of wine per day) might have heart benefits that outweigh the cancer risks. More recent work, however, has failed to support this idea, finding that any alcohol consumption is bad for health."><sup>11</sup></a></span> Similarly, Willett argues for reducing milk consumption across the board, whereas both textbooks I read argue for making milk a regular part of the diet for its calcium and vitamin D and choosing low-fat options to avoid its saturated fat. Willett also advocates for a daily multivitamin, something other sources have questioned. Given the quality of the source, it&#39;s hard to say whether Willett or the textbook is correct on the issues where they diverge, so I chalk those areas up to uncertainty amongst qualified experts.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Weigh-Less-Delicious-ebook/dp/B00CKUEVT4/">Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less</a> by Mollie Katzen and Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16969" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> While the previous book is an excellent summary of the state of nutritional science, it&#39;s not a weight-loss book, and parsing it for weight-loss recommendations might take some effort. Fortunately, Katzen and Willett have translated the dietary recommendations into a specific plan for someone who wants both to eat healthier and lose weight.</p><p> The basic strategy of all weight-loss diets is caloric restriction. However, reducing calories increases the risk of missing out on essential nutrients, which is a particular risk of fad or crash diets. This book might be worthwhile if you want to lose some weight in as healthful a way as possible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Nutrition-MindTap-Course-List/dp/0357447514/">Understanding Nutrition</a> by Ellie Whitney and Sharon Rady Rolfes </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="848" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16970" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg 848w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_.jpg 1242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></figure></div><p> This was my favorite textbook. While the detailed explanations of the biochemistry of energy metabolism might be unnecessary for most people, I love explanations that go deeper into the science.</p><p> One thing I didn&#39;t know, for instance, was that many of the body&#39;s cells rely on glucose for energy, but the body cannot make glucose from fat (it can make glucose from protein). Fat burning proceeds during low-intensity daily activity, but most physical activity requires some glucose for performance. This was one of many warnings against extremely low-carb diets I read in the more “official” sources I read for the month.</p><p> Interestingly, although the style and specific content covered differed between the textbooks I read, the recommendations for health in both textbooks were practically identical. I suspect this is because both are drawing on the same original source, rather than the authors independently arriving at the same conclusion. It doesn&#39;t mean the advice is without controversy, but it was at least satisfying to note there does appear to be some nutritional orthodoxy that one can point to as being consistent.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Academy-Nutrition-Dietetics-Complete-Guide/dp/0544520580/">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Complete Food &amp; Nutrition Guide</a> by Roberta L.

I jokingly referred to it as “the phone book,” owing to its heft, as I lugged it between my home and office. Like a phone book, it was also far from the most exciting read. I can&#39;t fault the author here, as it&#39;s meant to be a reference book, so I don&#39;t believe anyone was expecting it to be read cover-to-cover. But, that was exactly what I did, and I&#39;m glad I made it through.</p><p> This book covers nearly any possible question you might have about food, ranging from the safety of artificial sweeteners to the proper handling of poultry, different types of eating disorders to the efficacy of sports supplements. Impossible to summarize, “the phone book” will sit on my shelf for any time I need to look up a particular nutritional question.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh/dp/B0BT733QD8/">Everything Fat Loss</a> by Ben Carpenter </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16972" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51fS6eBWepL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Weight loss, perhaps even more so than general nutrition advice, is rampant with false promises, inflated hype, dangerous diets and outright scams.</p><p> I found Carpenter&#39;s book after seeing that it received the second-highest rating on Red Pen Reviews, after Willett&#39;s book.<span id='easy-footnote-12-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-16963' title="The only fault ascribed to this book by the reviewers seems to be that Carpenter suggests dieting may be worse for your mental health than research suggests."><sup>12</sup></a></span> This book is like an encyclopedia of body composition strategies, evaluating everything from low-carb to low-fat, from intermittent fasting to weight maintenance.</p><p> While the book is useful for its specifics, the general message is pretty simple: weight loss occurs through a calorie deficit.

We have evolved fascinating and complicated mechanisms to regulate our feelings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction and food reward that drive us to eat an appropriate amount. Except in our modern environment, these circuits often push us to maintain much more fat than is healthy.</p><p> Unfortunately, the takeaways from Guyenet&#39;s work are hardly the inspiring you-can-do-it messages of most diet books. Guyenet argues that, to a large extent, we overeat because food today is more tasty, plentiful, convenient and varied than it used to be, all of which encourages us to eat more than we should.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Gut-Taking-Control-Long-term/dp/1594206287/">The Good Gut</a> by Justin Sonnenburg and Erica Sonnenburg </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="673" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51sKLmKNVnL._SL1200_-673x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16974" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51sKLmKNVnL._SL1200_-673x1024.jpg 673w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51sKLmKNVnL._SL1200_-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51sKLmKNVnL._SL1200_-768x1168.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/51sKLmKNVnL._SL1200_.jpg 789w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></figure></div><p> The gut microbiome is one of the hot topics in nutritional research these days.<span id='easy-footnote-13-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-16963' title="Poop is popular.谁知道？"><sup>13</sup></a></span> The authors point to speculative links between our bacterial residents and allergies, obesity, memory and depression.</p><p> I found the book interesting, and it made me keen to add a little more kimchi and yogurt to my diet.

Carbs are also important for strength training since glucose, not fat, can be broken down anaerobically in muscle tissues for the power needed for hard workouts, and hard workouts are needed to provide the muscles with appropriate stimulus to grow.</p><p> The main difference is that the authors of this book focused, somewhat predictably, on eating more protein than was recommended in the guidance for endurance athletes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> by Michael Pollan </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16977" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/617EyeVlvL._SL1200_.jpg 782w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this book years ago, after liking Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/">The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</a> . At its heart, I basically agree with Pollan&#39;s advice and overall philosophy: eat real food, eat more plants, eat in moderation, and focus on cooking good food rather than consuming ultra-processed junk.</p><p> However, after reading many other books, I feel some of Pollan&#39;s tirades miss the mark. He spends a lot of time writing about how the “lipid hypothesis” that nutritionists recommended for years has been debunked. But then he casually flips back and forth between correctly rejecting the idea that all fat is bad and presenting the false idea that nutritional science has decided that saturated fats aren&#39;t worth worrying about (the consensus is that they are).</p><p> Similarly, Pollan gives a lot of space to both Gary Taubes and T. Colin Campbell. Taubes&#39; insistence that sugar is the cause of the obesity epidemic (as opposed to excess calorie consumption, in general) is <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode429/">probably false</a> . Campbell&#39;s advocacy of a strict vegetarian diet, in turn, is probably based on <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">some shaky science</a> .</p><p> That said, Pollan articulates better than anyone else I read the philosophy of eating, not just to optimize nutrition, but for living better. That means cooking real food, using whole ingredients with less processing, and trusting more traditional diets rather than scientifically engineered concoctions.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Food – Opening Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 07 Jan 2025 03:01:32 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16906 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m writing this on the first day of the fourth month in my year-long foundations project.

Untethered from good health and communal traditions, our eating behaviors are making us sick and lonely. We don&#39;t have time to cook and sit together for meals, and at the same time, obesity rates have skyrocketed.</p><p> Fixing this problem, even in one&#39;s own life, isn&#39;t easy. Just as it is evident we don&#39;t eat healthy on the whole, it is just as evident that the failure to eat healthy isn&#39;t any individual&#39;s “fault.” Our food environment has changed dramatically, and unconscious hormonal and neural signals that served our ancestors well now makes us sick.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Food History</h2><p> My own relationship with food is atypical. I had severe allergies to nuts and dairy as a child. Fortunately, I outgrew the dairy allergy, but it meant that my childhood was always centered around caution and avoidance of foods that were utterly normal to other people. I rarely had candy at Halloween, for instance, because few treats were safe. I was often the kid who brought a separate snack to a party because I didn&#39;t want to get sick.</p><p> As a teenager, I was persuaded that eating a vegetarian diet was the path to health. I read a few books, notably, <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">The China Study</a> , which made the argument that dropping animal products was a reliable path to healthy eating. Perhaps because of my early childhood experiences with food avoidance, I didn&#39;t find it difficult to stick to long-term.</p><p> I&#39;m more doubtful of the health benefits of veganism than I was as a teenager, but I still think they have a valid argument for both ethical and environmental reasons. Today, I eat fish, eggs and dairy, and I try not to be overly paranoid about other animal products in my food, consumed in small amounts—the way I see it, some degree of vegetarianism is probably better on the whole, but it&#39;s easy go overboard and be annoying to others regarding dietary restrictions.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t advocate for anyone to start eating as I do unless they are already interested in it. Most people fail to sustain extreme dietary restrictions, and it&#39;s not at all clear that meat ought to be the first thing to drop if you are simply trying to improve the health quality of your diet. Still, I tend to think a whole-food pescatarian diet is pretty healthy, so given that this is already the status quo for me, I don&#39;t feel compelled to make a shift to start eating more meat.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Food Falters</h2><p> Despite what may seem to many to be an already fairly restrictive diet, I can&#39;t say in all honesty that my eating patterns are maximally healthy. It&#39;s still possible to overeat, and plenty of junk food is totally vegan.</p><p> When I was in my early twenties, I could eat whatever I wanted without gaining any weight. Indeed, since I was often lifting weights, trying to gain weight was more frequently my challenge—I had to set an intention to try to put on pounds.</p><p> But, as I reached my late twenties, this was no longer true. Absent any special effort, I started to gain weight. At my peak, I weighed at least 20 lbs. above my typical college-aged weight and probably 15 lbs. above my ideal weight.</p><p> The reasons I gained weight were probably the same as everyone: I ate too much. I ate out frequently. Work and parenting pressures meant less sleep and more stress. I didn&#39;t exercise with the same vigor as my twenty-year-old self.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Refocusing on Health</h2><p> When I began working on my fitness foundation three months ago, I was naturally drawn to getting a head start on the reading for nutrition, too.</p><p> Owing to the confusion surrounding nutritional advice, and my own history of being overly swayed by a somewhat ideological author&#39;s advice for eating, I wanted to stick more to the science—keeping my focus on higher quality books as rated by independent reviewers, as well as following sources that scrutinize a lot of the scientific details behind dietary guidance.</p><p> This background reading, in combination with my renewed exercise habits, has led to a general improvement in my eating patterns. I&#39;ve now lost about 10 lbs. from my peak weight, even though restricting my food intake wasn&#39;t a priority.</p><p> Some of the things I strived for in the past few months that helped with this goal include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Eating more fruits and vegetables.</strong></li><li> <strong>Switching refined carbohydrates for whole grains when possible.</strong></li><li> <strong>Packing a lunch for work rather than eating out.</strong></li><li> <strong>Eating a big breakfast.</strong></li><li> <strong>Controlling portions when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Not snacking after dinner has finished.</strong></li></ul><p> These recommendations, which came up in my readings, seem to have worked well without any explicit aim to restrict calories. My case is probably atypical, but I was pleased to see that simply trying to eat healthier foods and managing my appetite seemed to be enough to lose some weight, along with the significant increase in my physical activity since the first month of this project.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Plans for the Month Ahead</h2><p> Since I&#39;ve already made many of the shifts I had initially planned to eat healthier, my focus for this month is largely trying to formalize the changes I am already doing informally.</p><p> In particular, I think the habits I want to sustain long-term are less like my earlier forays into highly restrictive eating patterns, but more about planning and preparation. The things I want to ensure I do this month include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Buy enough healthy food at the grocery store, so it&#39;s always available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Make sure I have healthy options for packing lunches.</strong></li><li> <strong>Have healthy options for snacking/desserts.</strong></li></ul><p> My breakfasts, lunches and snacks tend to be fairly independent, so I have the most control over those. But I eat dinners with my family, and I usually have a lunch or two per week with people I work with. Similarly, there are often events, family gatherings, vacations and other situations where having complete control over what I eat is unrealistic.</p><p> Therefore, for those situations less under my control, the behaviors I want to cultivate are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Choose healthier options when possible.</strong></li><li> <strong>Opt for reasonable portion sizes when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Plan ahead to eat healthy food before going to a place where only unhealthy options are available, so portion control becomes easier to attain.</strong></li></ul><p> These are guidelines, not hard rules. I think if I can be 80-90% successful with them, the moments where I indulge won&#39;t matter so much. My goal isn&#39;t to restrict myself from enjoying food I really do want, but to make it so such indulgences don&#39;t detract from an overall healthy eating pattern.</p><p> Additionally, I am taking the step of tracking what I eat for the month. This step is a bit a tedious, especially given that I&#39;m not really concerned about my dietary quality at the moment. However, since I have this month to focus on food, I figured it would give me some insight into my eating patterns that might be useful when I&#39;m no longer focusing on food, specifically.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Non-Nutritional Goals for Eating Better</h2><p> At this point, it may sound like I&#39;m trying to become a health-obsessed dieting weirdo. And I admit, this is a real concern. While it&#39;s pretty clear the standard Western diet is incredibly unhealthy, it&#39;s also pretty clear that an obsession with healthy eating is probably not great for your mental health.</p><p> My ultimate goal for the month is to establish enough strong habits and default options that thinking about healthy eating isn&#39;t an issue—it&#39;s just what I do unthinkingly in most situations. But I also want to recognize those situations where health isn&#39;t my primary goal when eating. Noticing how my plans interfere with these non-nutritional goals is also important, because I want to make my habits sustainable, and I want to eat delicious food, too.</p><p> I want to be able to enjoy family gatherings, eat at restaurants and on vacation, enjoy a wide variety of delicious foods and not feel hungry throughout the day. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on these factors as well, because a maximally healthy diet that means eating monotonous, bland meals in isolation is something I neither want nor can sustain.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Want to Improve Your Foundation for This Month?</h2><p> I&#39;m going into a lot more detail on the lessons I&#39;m gathering from my research in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> . But anyone who wants to improve how they eat is welcome to join me, informally, for this month&#39;s project.</p><p> The habit we&#39;re cultivating this month is flexible food planning. This simply means taking steps to shape your food environment, from buying healthier food at the grocery store to planning healthier meals. If you&#39;re really serious about changing your diet, you&#39;re also welcome to go all the way to fully planning your meals a week in advance and tracking your calories, but this additional step is not necessary for most people to make improvements. Even little things like dropping sugary drinks or adding more vegetables to your plate are still worth doing.</p><p> At the end of the month, I&#39;ll share notes from the books I read, as well as provide an update of how my month focused on food went.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/">Food – Opening Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Money – Month-End Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:02:21 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16886 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m now rounding out the third month in my year-long project to improve my foundations.

I’m working three months ahead of the publication of these posts to make it easier to produce all the content for my Foundations course."><sup>15</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus was money. In particular, the keystone habit I asked students of <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">my course</a> to work on this month was setting up a system to track their expenses and reviewing it at least monthly.</p><p> Monthly expense tracking has been a habit of mine for almost two decades, so my personal challenge this month was to:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Improve my tracking.</strong> Prior to this month, my wife and I tracked dozens of different spending categories. We reorganized our system so we have main categories and subcategories, making it easy to see how much we spend on “big picture” items while also having enough detail that we can get specific in any particular area (for instance, how much of our food costs is due to eating out versus groceries?)</li><li> <strong>Get term life insurance.</strong> I applied for term life insurance for myself. I decided to get a policy that would cover our outstanding mortgage balance, since the other financial assets I have should be enough to cover any other expenses.</li><li> <strong>Rebalance my assets.</strong> This was a concern of mine as I don&#39;t feel my asset allocation so far has been done in a particularly principled way. However, reading dozens of books (including the better part of a 1000-page textbook on investing) didn&#39;t really persuade me to change my strategy much. I probably want to start shifting some of my assets into a bond index, but I&#39;d rather do that with newer savings rather than rebalancing the investments I already have. I still think, given my age and work flexibility, an 80-90 percent equity portfolio is the way to go. </li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Foundations Conversation: Month 3 Update - Money" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbJPBlC9cpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p> Overall, my money foundation month was more about deepening my knowledge base rather than radically changing my habits. Going in, I felt pretty good about my overall savings levels, investment strategy and money management in general, but it was nice to dig a bit deeper into this topic and affirm some of my long-standing commitments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Planning for My Financial Future</h2><p> Another step I took this month was to do some explicit calculations of my financial goals. I ran a few scenarios looking at what I can expect long-term under different future conditions based on my current assets.</p><p> This exercise helped me see what my financial position would be if I tried to retire immediately, in ten years, or not until I&#39;m in my seventies. I don&#39;t plan on stopping work anytime soon, but sometimes misfortune strikes and we&#39;re not given that choice. It was a useful exercise for seeing how my financial foundation could support my family in the case that my business failed or I somehow became incapable of earning a similar income.</p><p> This kind of analysis of net worth and retirement goals is not complicated to do, but I had never actually done it before.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Feeling Good About Money</h2><p> Another thing this month helped me with was with feeling better about my money, in general. For years, I have been comfortably saving more than I was spending, so I didn&#39;t think much about money at all. But my wife and I bought a house two years ago, and the combined pressure of watching the investments we had for the down payment take a tumble, having a mortgage, and seeing interest rates rise<span id='easy-footnote-16-16886' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-16886' title="To the confused Americans, we got a 5-year variable-rate mortgage. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the default in the US, but it isn’t common here in Canada."><sup>16</sup></a></span> added some financial stress.</p><p> I don&#39;t say this as a complaint—I&#39;m acutely aware of how fortunate we are. But it was stressful, nonetheless.</p><p> Doing the work of comparing our actual spending to our current financial picture, including the variety of possible future scenarios for investment return, interest rates, and even my ability to work and continue this business, made me a lot more comfortable about our plans going forward 。 While there&#39;s a stereotype of the person who doesn&#39;t look at their bank accounts to avoid financial anxiety, I think I tend to be the opposite. If I can&#39;t see what my goals are and whether or not I&#39;m reaching them, I get more anxious about spending, especially when things like my mortgage payments jump up considerably.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Being Committed to the Strategy</h2><p> The other lesson I took from my extensive reading this month was the importance of emotional resolve in one&#39;s financial plan. It&#39;s relatively easy to describe an investing strategy, but it seems it&#39;s much harder to commit to a plan when it&#39;s losing money in the short-term, even if it is a good strategy in the long-term.</p><p> I decided not to alter my asset allocation considerably, despite all my reading. One reason for this was simply that I feel like the informational bar for making changes to your investing strategy needs to be relatively high, otherwise there&#39;s a temptation to panic when the market crashes, or chase winners when the market is irrationally high. In this sense, I feel like a relatively simple strategy with fewer funds and choices is probably better for me, even if it isn&#39;t completely optimal from a theoretical perspective. Simplicity is easier to commit to intellectually and stick to in practice even when it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s paying off. It&#39;s hard to have the discipline to rebalance your portfolio *into* the “losers” year after year to stay consistent with a strategy, so having fewer items to rebalance seems valuable  from a behavioral standpoint.</p><p> Time will tell whether my particular choices were correct, but I have become more convinced that commitment matters more than cleverness when it comes to managing investments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Updates to Fitness and Productivity</h2><p> In addition to working on my money this month, I also sustained my previous two foundations, fitness and productivity.</p><p> Fitness continued to go well. I&#39;ve now had my third month where I haven&#39;t missed a daily workout, although a couple of those defaulted to a low-intensity stretch. I now feel like my cardiovascular fitness is about as good as it&#39;s ever been. I&#39;m still rebuilding my strength to get to my past peak of about 5 years ago, but I haven&#39;t plateaued yet.</p><p> I&#39;m also about 10 lbs. lighter than when I began three months ago. Losing weight wasn&#39;t an initial goal, but it&#39;s been a nice perk.</p><p> The productivity system I initially set up continues, although I still feel like there are a few kinks that need ironing out. I think being more consistent about the weekly and daily reviews, especially the collaborative ones with my wife at the end of the week, are essential for getting the system to work smoothly.</p><p> Still, I feel like productivity was already a solid foundation for me, so this is more of an effort to smooth off some remaining rough edges.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> With the first quarter of the year-long project concluding, I&#39;m feeling good about going into the next nine months. Next month focuses on food—I&#39;ll share my opening update for that one next week!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/">Money – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
