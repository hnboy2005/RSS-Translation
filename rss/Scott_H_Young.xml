href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">书籍</a>。</li></ol><p>我选择了这一重点作为十二人之一，因为我认为经常阅读的习惯，尤其是从书籍中阅读，是您一生中最好的基础习惯之一。这也是人们所做的频率频率的频率：大多数成年人读书比过去几十年来少，毫无疑问，智能手机兴起引起的趋势。</p><p>但是，读书是我擅长的东西。到目前为止，我定期为该项目的每个月至少阅读10本书，通常包括至少两本针对每个主题的大学级教科书。虽然我的阅读量往往会在我的项目上上下移动，但在阅读对我的工作至关重要的一年中，我可以轻松阅读一百本书。

/></figure></div><p>因此，我这个月的个人目标将与我鼓励其他人在本月建造的习惯有所不同，即始终拥有一本书。我将在这篇文章的结尾进行更多建议，但否则我将重点放在下一个月的工作上。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">两个目标：就寝时间阅读和增加的广度</h2><p>我本月有两个目标。首先是在入睡前养成习惯阅读的习惯。我有时会这样做，但不是一致。我的希望不是增加我的阅读量，而是想利用这种习惯来鼓励更好（及早）睡眠。</p><p>我不会为就寝时间留下最低的门槛，因为由于社交活动，我会熬夜，这很快就会成为负担。但是我认为，即使只有一分钟的时间就有习惯，即使只有一分钟，也会鼓励我比看屏幕更快。</p><p>我当月的第二个目标是花更多的时间阅读我通常的非小说类重点之外的书籍。虽然我喜欢文学和主题非小说类书籍，但当我从事研究项目时，它们肯定会坐下来。随着我转移到未来的几个月，我可能无法维持这个广度，但是我将利用本月的时间来计划一些长期阅读列表，这些阅读清单在我所读的少于我想要的领域。</p><p>这是我想阅读更多书籍的一些类别：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>经典文学。</strong>自从读赫希（Hirsch）的书争论文化素养以来，我一直被鼓励以更多的经典小说作品扩大阅读。</li><li><strong>宗教作品。</strong>我不是宗教信仰，但我认为宗教是一个值得阅读的话题，因为它的文化意义及其对日常生活的教训。</li><li><strong>历史。</strong>我经常在研究我的书籍时读过很多传记，但是我对很多历史的信息却不太了解。鉴于历史知识往往是庞大的，我想在这里努力扩展。</li><li><strong>用其他语言的书籍。</strong>我在其他语言中的对话练习几乎没有以前的练习。这是我成为父母时节省时间的必要牺牲之一。但是，我想维护的语言阅读更多，更容易适应我想培养的东西。</li></ol><p>我已经有一些这些主题中的书籍，可能在未来的一个月中足够了，但是我将在本月准备一些长期列表，所以当这些最初的想法运行时，我将有更多书籍可供选择出去。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">亚哈：总是有一本书</h2><p>我鼓励人们在本月培养的<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基金会</a>习惯比我的个人目标更简单。从观察到，阅读更多内容的主要障碍根本没有您<em>现在</em>不兴奋的内容。</p><p>解决此问题的做法可以用简单的首字母缩写Ahab进行总结，也可以“始终有一本书”。</p><p>目的是让您有兴趣随时与您一起阅读的书。这并不意味着您需要随身携带大型平装书。使用Kindle和Audible Apps，您现在可以在智能手机上保留整个库。</p><p>设置此内容意味着要收到很多书籍 - 购买或从当地图书馆借用它们。</p><p>这也意味着优先考虑您对阅读感兴趣的书籍。人们试图阅读更多赚钱的常见错误是试图完成他们已经开始的任何无聊的书。然后，由于他们实际上不想阅读它，所以他们在社交媒体上花费更多的时间。</p><p>如果您已经是读者，那么您可以用更艰难的书籍来挑战自己。但是，如果您每月至少不定期阅读一本书，我鼓励您养成挑选自己喜欢的书的习惯，甚至没有对未能完成任何不再感兴趣的书感到内gui。</p><p>我长期以来一直练习Ahab的习惯，但即使我偶尔会滑倒。我将有几本纸质书籍，但没有Kindle书籍，这意味着我在手机上检查了新闻，而不是阅读。或者我没有听听的有声读物，这意味着即使我想听一本书，我也无法听音乐或播客。</p><p>因此，作为我自己挑战的一部分，我正在积极地库存所有的书籍，所以我在办公室，床头柜，Kindle应用程序和Audible上准备了很多书。</p><p>顺便说一句，我也希望本月能在项目中放松一下。<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基金会课程</a>的开始，加上研究丰富的<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">食物</a>和<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/">金钱的</a>月份，使我的工作量在过去两个月中略高一些。自从我一生的最后几年阅读有关学习的书籍以来，我的阅读书清单本月可能会有些轻一些，我将使用这种停机时间来阅读或听更多的偏离题为图书。</p><p>与往常一样，我将分享这个重点在本月底以及我喜欢的一些书。</p><p>帖子<a

class="wp-block-heading">饮食更好，更健康</h2><p>这个月有点不寻常，因为我在健身月份做了我想对饮食习惯做出的大部分更改，这是我为期一年的项目的第一个月。尽管我读了很多东西，并加深了我对我不清楚的营养的许多方面的了解，但从行为上讲，我已经对这个月开始的饮食习惯感到非常满意。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17015"

/></figure></div><p>因此，我这个月的重点是跟踪我的食物摄入量。特别是，我很想知道我的实际饮食习惯如何符合饮食指南以及我自己对自己的健康状况的主观意识。</p><p>作为一个实验，我发现跟踪本月的食物摄入量提供信息。在营养信息方面，我了解到：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>我几乎总是得到纤维的最低建议。</strong></li><li><strong>我通常是饱和脂肪的阈值。</strong></li><li><strong>我消耗的钠比应有的。</strong>我通常已经结束了，这可能是一个底漆，因为我的跟踪可能错过了家常菜肴中添加的盐。</li><li><strong>我的蛋白质摄入量高于DRI，但如果我不希望将其包括在每餐中，则可以低于</strong>力量训练的最佳选择。</li></ol><p>我本来希望在饮食中了解更多有关微量营养素的信息，但是我使用的软件无法很好地跟踪这些软件。很少有食物可靠地列出诸如Omega-3或其他微量营养素含量之类的东西，以至于我的饮食（从红肉中戒除的饮食）在锌还是铁上是否含量很低。</p><p>除营养信息外，我还获得了许多行为数据：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>我倾向于在餐馆吃饭或让客人过来和烹饪大型晚餐时倾向于过度食物。当我自己煮食物并与家人一起吃饭时，吃适量的份量很容易做到。</li><li>我不经常喝酒，但是喝酒使我措手不及。</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我的一些早期结果</h2><p>当然，大多数人不会追踪食物摄入以获得见识。他们追踪减肥。我本月并不是要减轻很多体重，但是我使用的应用程序（MacRotracker）要求它设置目标。尽管我对坚持推荐的卡路里的态度很矛盾，但我确实在大多数时候都坚持了大部分时间，并损失了大约4磅。从本月初。</p><p>虽然我主要归功于四个月前开始的健身和饮食变化，而不是本月的具体努力，但我对自己整体身体成分的进步感到非常满意。我现在从大约178磅的山峰下降约165磅。项目开始前不久。</p><p>我在测量腰围方面并不一致，但这也发生了变化：它在项目的第一个月的某个时候开始了37英寸左右，现在约为33英寸。鉴于我处于“健康” BMI范围，因此我将在长期内更加关注该指标，因为肌肉的增长和损失<em>本身</em>会模糊体重减轻的任何影响。</p><p>与过去几年相比，要变得更苗条，更接近我的大学时代的体重真是太好了，但是我也尽力不关注它。我对体重恢复的悲观数据感到痛苦，因此，我宁愿长期致力于维持健康和健身。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么我不追踪长期</h2><p>虽然我对追踪食物的实验是有益的，但这并不是我将来要维持的行为。从一开始，跟踪很烦人，但是现在它是一种习惯，所以我认为跟踪的行为并不是主要问题。取而代之的是，我认为跟踪我所吃的东西产生了一些不必要的副作用，使我分心了我真正想吃的东西：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>跟踪鼓励您吃易于轨道的食物，而不是健康食品。</strong>在跟踪劝阻一些不良的食物选择，例如垃圾食品，但我发现它也巧妙地鼓励了带有营养标签的食物，最终会增加加工食品而不是全食。</li><li><strong>跟踪鼓励关注卡路里（或宏），而不是营养品质的其他方面。</strong>这可能是我正在使用的应用程序的副作用，但是我发现诸如卡路里计数或克蛋白质/脂肪/碳水化合物之类的游戏化可以鼓励您使用该镜头来查看营养，但是这种方法并没有真正支持我的整体研究。这样的重点会鼓励您将全麦面包和白面包看成，而当它们真正地与众不同时，它们基本上是相同的营养。</li><li><strong>跟踪鼓励注意数字而不是内部感觉。</strong>跟踪月份给了我对过去三个月所追踪的更加注意饮食方式的重新感谢。当您专注于卡路里时，即使您饿了，当您结束时，您就会有更多的食用，即使您饿了。如果您在暴饮暴食中挣扎，这可能会很好，但是我发现这让我不听取自己的饥饿感和饱腹感，而是将应用程序带来地面真相。</li></ol><p>虽然跟踪的研究在整体效率方面往往相当积极，但为了长期饮食，我将专注于通常吃高营养优质的食物，尽可能地身体活跃并保持警惕我吃的足够了 - 不是太多或太少了。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">食物，超越营养</h2><p>我本月要离开我的饮食感到满意。这个月的一个失望是，跟踪的行为比我预期的更多的时间全神贯注，所以我觉得这个月最终比我最初预期的要多于<em>营养</em>（而不是食物的其他方面）。我还想专注于烹饪，探索新食谱并找到更多的方法，以使更健康的饮食定期更令人满意。</p><p>既然我正在暂停跟踪，我认为我将能够恢复其中的其他一些愿望，当本文发表本文时，我一定会重新审视它们<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基础课程</a>中的每个人。</p><p>总的来说，我对这个月的表现感到满意。我对自己的饮食习惯有所了解，建议自己参加四个月前开始的变化，甚至设法减掉了几磅。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">健身，生产力和金钱的更新</h2><p>关于我在前三个基础上的持续进展的快速更新：</p><p>为了健身，我继续取得了长足的进步。我做了两次长达21公里的长跑，半程马拉松比赛，到目前为止，我有史以来最长的跑步。现在，我可以连续进行9次上拉，而我开始进行3次上拉。我仍然低于重大升降机的峰值强度，但是我靠近了。</p><p>为了生产力，我不能说发生了很大变化。我更好地与我的妻子跟踪和协调许多与工作相关的任务，但是时间仍然有限，并且仍然很难保持低优先的琐事。我接受的是，总会有更多的事情要做，并试图对自己能够完成的工作感到良好。</p><p>为了钱，我实际上是通过每月的费用跟踪来落后的。这在很大程度上是创建新的跟踪模板的副作用，因此需要在进行前进之前进行交易的过去一年。鉴于我已经跟踪了近二十年的费用，所以我不太担心，但我希望能赶上。</p><p>这个月也非常忙。因为我在介绍班级中的每个主题之前三个月写了这些更新，并且在这里出版了这些更新，所以（对我来说）与新生一起<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">基础课程</a>的第一个月。我喜欢教学，但与仅做一个孤独项目相比，这肯定会增加我的工作量。此外，我的妻子摔断了脚，这迫使我们的许多日常习惯和育儿任务进行了重组。</p><p>下个月的重点是阅读，这是我已经很满足的基础，因此我希望它能在我的终点里有点喘息。</p><p>邮政<a

href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">生活</a>。在我们这样做之前，我想借此机会解释焦点的生活如何工作，因为这与大多数人从在线课程中获得的期望有所不同，并分享我对设计课程的看法，以鼓励行为改变。</p><p>经典课程就是提供信息。有一个有内容列表的教学大纲；传达思想，事实和概念的一堆讲座；最后，有一项考试可以测试您是否记得所教的一切。</p><p>对于许多主题，这个模型没有错。在许多领域，信息是缺少的，因此花一些时间学习是最好的动作。</p><p>但是，从近二十年来开发在线课程中，我经常对构建课程的经典方法如何转化为行动感到失望。问题在于，许多信息本身很少转化为具体的行为改变。例如，关于营养的课程将为您提供许多有用的概念和更好的饮食概念，但实际上可能不会改变您的饮食方式，这是大多数人的最终目标。</p><p>当我和Cal Newport开始设计重点生活时，我们知道这将是我们课程的潜在问题。 Cal最近发表了<em>深入的工作</em>和<em>数字极简主义</em>。我们的大多数潜在学生要么阅读这些书，要么遵循Cal的博客或播客，并且已经熟悉他在工作和生活中越来越重点的呼吁。</p><p>我们知道，参加该课程的人们在进行深入工作或有关注意力处理的神经科学时就不需要更多的劝告来关闭电子邮件。取而代之的是，我们设计了该课程，以指导他们通过特定的步骤来创建新的工作行为，并具有跟进，以便这些行为可能成为终身习惯。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">以动作为中心的课程的格式</h2><p>因此，重点的生活（以及我最近的课程，基础）遵循的模型与我们通常认为的课程不同。</p><p>首先，该课程被组织成三个每月的挑战。我们没有将课程作为可选的奖励，而不是将在线课程很少完成作业的大多数人面对现实吧），而是采取行动以提高我们的焦点，然后提供常规的课程来提醒和加强这些动作已经在进行中。</p><p>重点生活的三个挑战是：</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>跟踪您的深入工作时间</strong></li><li><strong>进行数字整理，并</strong></li><li><strong>参与一个焦点建设项目，以制造或学习一些新的东西。</strong></li></ul><p>作为典型课程格式的另一种反转，我们每个月都从一个指导的工作表开始。这可以帮助学生提出他们可以采取的分步操作，以开始为期一个月的最佳挑战。只有一旦学生开始挑战，我们才能开始提供课程，以进行微调，提醒，激励和重定向学生。</p><p>最重要的是，我们添加了很多直接的社区支持和教练，以便学生可以在他们摆脱挑战或灰心之前迅速解决他们的注意点。</p><p>简而言之，重点生活的形式更像是体育馆的私人教练，而不是运动科学的大学课程。通过鼓励一开始的行动，课程和反馈支持行为改变。</p><p>尽管Cal和我不确定这种新颖的课程格式将如何与学生一起使用，但我们感到非常惊喜，许多学生告诉我们，聚焦生活是他们与我们一起学习的最喜欢的课程。自从他们首次入学以来，许多学生甚至多次参加了课程，将第二和第三次通过，是使用它提供的三个月结构进一步完善其过程的机会。</p><h2

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>焦点很难。自从我开始写作以来的几年中，它变得越来越困难。</p><p>多动症（包括自我诊断）的诊断飙升。虽然其中一些可能是由于围绕心理健康问题的污名降低了，但揭示了已经存在的问题，但轶事，看来人们比以往的时间更加困难。</p><p>我认识的人数很难完成阅读一本书，或者似乎在没有打开电子邮件的情况下持续超过二十分钟的人，似乎越来越糟。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">智能手机会破坏我们的大脑吗？</h2><p>尽管技术肯定在我们的集体分辨率中发挥了作用，但Google实际上并不是让我们变得愚蠢，或者我们失去了专注的能力。我同意认知心理学家丹尼尔·威灵厄姆（Daniel Willingham）的观点，他对我们的基本脑建筑可以通过这种方式重塑的想法引起了人们的关注。</p><p>取而代之的是，对于为什么焦点很难，以及为什么它变得越来越困难，有一个简单的解释。简而言之，维持注意事物的能力是两个因素的函数：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>拉</strong>。<strong> </strong>这是一项活动吸引的程度并激励我们维持我们的注意力。真正的多任务是一个神话，我们的注意力只能一次关注一件事情。结果，活动的拉力始终是<em>相对于我们目前可能要关注的所有其他所有事物的定义。</em></li><li><strong>摩擦</strong>。<strong> </strong>这是维持参与活动所需的抵抗力，困难或努力。太多的摩擦，甚至应该引人注目的东西也被推出，以便于替代方案。 </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pull-Friction-productivity-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16936" style="width:450px"

/></figure></div><p>这两个因素有助于解释为什么聚焦最近变得如此困难。现在，我们正处于一个无处不在的环境中，与社交媒体或流媒体电视的吸引相比，阅读一本好书的相对吸引力太安静了。</p><p>其次，我们许多最有力的干扰已经变得越来越无摩擦。当我二十年前开始写博客时，阅读我的供稿意味着用我的计算机（我仍然有一个桌面）去房间，将其打开（永远花了），连接到互联网，打开我的RSS feft读者并滚动浏览一个未经保修的简单标题列表，以决定要阅读的内容。</p><p>如果我出生了二十年后，我会拥有Tiktok，这只需要从我的口袋里拿出一个设备，而任何内容 *它都认为最有趣的是瞬间地对我来说。</p><p> “愚蠢”的媒体和老式的爱好并没有发生太大变化，与他们一直都有相同的拉力和摩擦。但是他们无法与我们现在定期遇到的注意力糖果竞争。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">如何提高专注能力</h2><p>这两个部分的焦点模型为如何更好地集中精力提出了一个简单的答案：增加活动的相对拉力，减少摩擦或两者兼而有之。而且，由于拉力和摩擦是相对于所有显着替代方案定义的，因此您可以通过减少最诱人的干扰的摩擦或增加摩擦来实现相同的影响。</p><p>让我们考虑所有四种可能性：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>增加聚焦的吸引力</strong>。阅读更多有趣的书。选择您觉得引人注目的爱好。加入小组，将社交与您喜欢的活动融合在一起。衡量您的进度，并给自己奖励，只是为了露面。</li><li><strong>减少聚焦的摩擦</strong>。总是有书籍。让您的爱好“现成”，而不是需要冗长的设置。停止阅读让您感到无聊的书（而是阅读其他内容）。使您可以快速浸入您关心的事物。</li><li><strong>减少分心的吸引力</strong>。将手机放在灰度上。<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">将您的媒体消耗切换到RSS提要</a>，而不是算法策划的来源。</li><li><strong>增加分心的摩擦</strong>。将手机放在您家中专用的位置，而不是臀部。从手机删除应用程序，因此您需要使用计算机登录。</li></ol><p>可以采用类似的四倍策略来改善您的专注工作，而不仅仅是您的集中休闲：增加深度工作的吸引力，减少浅水工作的吸引力，减少深层工作的摩擦，增加浅水工作的摩擦。</p><p>转移到更加集中的生活需要时间和工作。这些变化都不是自动的，他们感到自然可能需要一段时间。但是，如果您现在投资于更加集中的生活，那么您可以在未来的所有几年中收获股息。有足够的时间，这些习惯将变得自动，果然，您会发现自己正在阅读更多书籍，从事更有趣的爱好并完成更有意义的项目。</p><p>我与CAL Newport的课程共同教授的<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life Life</a>将于1月27日星期一开始。如果您有兴趣加入，我将在周一发送注册信息。我期待与一群专门的学生合作，以帮助他们提高注意力并在2025年实现更大的目标！</p><p><a

class="wp-block-heading">您如何最大化工艺？</h2><p>定义很好，但是您实际上是如何做到的？显然，在工作和家里，总会有不可避免的琐事。在实践中，花更多的时间在手工上，虽然听起来不错，但很难实现。</p><p>我相信答案是集中精力的。 In your work, if you can carve out regular chunks of time for deep work, you&#39;ll start automatically shifting your work toward the dimension of “craft” and away from “chores.” In the beginning, that shift might come from simply being more efficient with the chores, even if their quantity hasn&#39;t diminished. But, eventually, as you build “craft” accomplishments, it becomes easier to delegate and avoid chores in favor of more time spent on your craft.</p><p> We tend to specialize at what we regularly do, and if you spend your time on deep work, it creates a gravitational pull towards more deep work. Likewise, getting really good at chores makes you the person who gets assigned more chores.</p><p> At home, things are not quite as simple. Short of hiring an army of help, many chores will need to be done. But here, too, steps to maximize craft often succeed by squeezing out the hours spent on activities that are neither necessary chores nor meaningful crafts—the filler time spent endlessly scrolling on our phones or watching television shows we don&#39;t even enjoy.</p><p> In the previous lesson, I argued that this year should be a year for doing something big—actually finishing a project you&#39;ve had in mind for some time. Now, I&#39;d like to encourage you to go further, to think about maximizing the feeling of craft throughout your life. Doing activities that require full engagement, genuine skill and give you a feeling of satisfaction when they&#39;re completed.</p><p> In the next lesson, I&#39;ll share a simple model for how to think about focus. In particular, what you can do to overcome some of your own internal resistance to maximizing craft and achieving big things.

I think you should, too.</p><p> Projects exist in the middle space of our productive activities. At one end we have tasks, the myriad things that need doing in our day-to-day lives: filing taxes, walking the dog, doing laundry, submitting that report. At the other end are our grand dreams for our lives: to be financially independent, travel the world, build a business or raise successful kids.</p><p> Grand dreams are nice, but they&#39;re generally not very practical. It&#39;s easy to get excited as you think them over, but rarely does even the most compelling grand dream tell you what, precisely, you should be doing on Tuesday morning to make it come true. Their size and distance makes them poor objects for sustaining motivation.</p><p> Tasks and to-do lists suffer from the opposite problem. You can check off lots of tasks while accomplishing nothing major. Sure, the house is a little cleaner, maybe you&#39;ve balanced your chequebook and fixed the wobbly chair in the dining room, but these, like most tasks, simply sustain your current life. They don&#39;t take you somewhere new.</p><p> Projects act as the bridge between grand dreams and daily action. A big life goal often can be achieved in a project or two. And a project can be achieved through a coordinated series of tasks. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16931" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Project-task-ambitions-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Mindset Needed to Habitually Complete Projects</h2><p> Being good at completing projects requires a different mindset than being merely productive (and thus being good at checking off tasks) or ambitious (and thus coming up with grand visions for your life).</p><p> Completing projects requires focus. Focus is not just the ability to sit down and work at something hard for hours at a time; it&#39;s also learning how to ignore all the other things screaming for your attention. Sometimes those other things are entertainment or distractions. More often, they&#39;re legitimate tasks and work that, if you heed their siren song, will have you crashing against the rocky shore of minutiae long before you reach your ambitious destination.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> It&#39;s Time to Finish What You Start</h2><p> My guess is that you already have some project ideas. Perhaps some you&#39;ve idly thought about. Perhaps some you&#39;ve already committed to. Perhaps some that oscillate between daydreams and serious efforts.</p><p> This year, I suggest you go ahead and finish one of them. It doesn&#39;t need to be the largest or most difficult project on your list—but it should be something that matters to you. Make this the year that you don&#39;t just *think* about doing it, but actually finish it.</p><p> Certainly, this is easier said than done. Perhaps you have dreamt up projects that have gone nowhere. Maybe you&#39;ve even insisted that “this time it&#39;s different,” and you&#39;re finally going to complete a project you&#39;ve been thinking about for years—only to succumb to the relentless tide of distractions in the months ahead.</p><p>我们都去过那里。</p><p> If you are looking for help with this, I encourage you to join the upcoming session of our course, Life of Focus. In it, we&#39;ll help you set and achieve a consistent deep work target—a necessity for making sustained progress. We&#39;ll declutter your leisure time—creating space to tackle big things. And we&#39;ll cultivate your ability to sustain your attention in the way, and on the things, you choose.</p><p> The full three-month course is a great complement to any big goal you&#39;ve been meaning to accomplish, but I want to leave you with one strategy you can apply today: right now, start tracking the hours you spend working on the project you have in mind.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t require fancy software or complicated calculations. A simple piece of paper where you tally every uninterrupted hour of work towards your project will suffice.</p><p> Put the tally on your wall, on your phone, or anywhere you will look at it often. By maintaining a visual reminder of your decision to focus, you can steadily move in the right direction.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p> <em><a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/lifeoffocus/">Life of Focus</a> , my three-month course co-taught with Cal Newport, will reopen for a new session on Monday, January 27, 2025.</em></p></blockquote><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/">Lesson One: Do Something Big This Year</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/19/do-something-big/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 14 Jan 2025 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16963 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Looking to eat better?

I decided to publish this one a little in advance because we’ll be holding a new session of Life of Focus in just over a week."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus is on food.</p><p> Part of my goal for each month is to read as much as I can about each topic, both for my own knowledge and to try to summarize the essential expert recommendations for those participating in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">course</a> .</p><p> Food is a particularly tricky subject. Nutritional science is complicated—and often conflicting. Popular media on this topic is a cesspool of misinformation, hype, and some downright dangerous advice being presented as the road to good health.</p><p> Still, I wanted to do my best to get it right. Given my complete lack of credentials in this area, that meant focusing my reading more on textbooks (I read two, each 800+ pages), popular books noted for their scientific accuracy (I read three specifically for their high ratings from the non-profit <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/">Red Pen Reviews</a> ), and those written by scholars I respect. I also made heavy use of the podcast <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/">Sigma Nutrition</a> , which presents academic discussions of nutritional research.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16963' title="I wouldn’t normally recommend a podcast in place of a scholarly reference source, but I found the detailed discussions of nutritional research to be much more nuanced than most other sources, including textbooks, I found elsewhere."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p><p> I can&#39;t say for sure that I got it all right. But after having read a few thousand pages and listened to many hours of scientific discussions, I suspect that much of the residual confusion I have is likely embedded in the field itself rather than a simple misunderstanding on my part.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The 3-Minute Summary of What I Learned (and Unlearned)</h2><p> In terms of concision, it&#39;s hard to beat Michael Pollan&#39;s overall eating advice:</p><p class="has-text-align-left"> <strong>“Eat food.不多。 Mostly plants.”</strong></p><p> Despite the complexity and contention of the underlying research, most advice for eating well is pretty basic: </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> Eat more whole foods.</li><li> Eat more fruits and vegetables.</li><li> Eat more fiber.</li><li> Eat a range of different food types and foods within each type.</li><li>多吃全谷物。</li><li> Go easy on the refined grains, added sugars, processed meat and saturated fat.</li></ul></blockquote><p> A seventh recommendation, though not universally agreed to, might be “Try to eat a bit more protein, particularly from plant and marine sources.”</p><p> But, in addition to these fairly uncontroversial ideas, I also found some repeated ideas that surprised me somewhat:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Egg yolks aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Dietary cholesterol has a pretty minimal effect on blood cholesterol. Egg yolks famously have a lot of cholesterol, so they were unnecessarily vilified.</li><li> <strong>Too much saturated fat is still bad for you.</strong> Trans fats are worse, of course, but most sources recommend swapping solid fats in your diet, like lard and butter, for healthy oils to reduce the risk of heart disease.</li><li> <strong>Carbs aren&#39;t bad for you.</strong> Carbs have replaced fat as the dietary villain of our age, but carbs are the body&#39;s preferred energy source. Unrefined grains and carbs from fruit and vegetables are a boon for health.</li><li> <strong>Most additives in food are safe.</strong> Whole foods are good, of course, but the belief that small amounts of preservatives or chemical food additives are the source of ill health seems largely unfounded. Processing strips nutrients and reformulates foods to make them easier to overconsume, but the additives themselves are largely harmless.</li><li> <strong>Coffee and chocolate are healthy.</strong> In moderation, coffee appears to be a net positive for health. Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, seems to be good as well. Chocolate has a lot of calories, so it&#39;s easy to overconsume, but the type of saturated fat present in cacao isn&#39;t harmful.</li></ol><p> Despite this, there are still some controversies I couldn&#39;t find a straight answer on.

Not only is it the most highly-rated book in terms of scientific accuracy and healthfulness on Red Pen Reviews, but Willett is the world&#39;s most-cited nutritional researcher.</p><p> The most engaging/fun read of the month was a re-read, Michael Pollan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/">In Defense of Food</a> . His high-level recommendations on eating are difficult to fault, and there is much to say in favor of his philosophy of common-sense nutrition. I disagree with Pollan on some research he cites, but I feel like you&#39;d hardly be led astray if you stick with his practical takeaways.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s look at some notes from each book:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/1501164775/">Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</a> by Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16968" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8146GKUoEiL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Co-developed by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, this book is perhaps the most scientifically reputable, popular diet book available today. Willett, whose work on the Nurses&#39; Health Study made him one of the world&#39;s most-esteemed nutritional epidemiologists, provides his perspective on what science says we should eat to be healthy.</p><p> Most of the recommendations fit within the Mediterranean diet pattern—so-called because the famous Seven Countries Study found that inhabitants of Crete had much lower rates of heart disease, owing to their eating whole grains, lots of vegetables and seafood, little red meat and plenty of olive oil.</p><p> Despite its impeccable credentials, this book does depart in some ways from some of my other reading on nutrition. Willett continues to recommend moderate alcohol consumption for health, something that more recent data seem to be undermining.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16963' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16963' title="For clarification, it&amp;#8217;s long been known that excessive alcohol consumption is bad for you. But until recently, it was believed that moderate consumption (e.g., 1-2 glasses of wine per day) might have heart benefits that outweigh the cancer risks. More recent work, however, has failed to support this idea, finding that any alcohol consumption is bad for health."><sup>7</sup></a></span> Similarly, Willett argues for reducing milk consumption across the board, whereas both textbooks I read argue for making milk a regular part of the diet for its calcium and vitamin D and choosing low-fat options to avoid its saturated fat. Willett also advocates for a daily multivitamin, something other sources have questioned. Given the quality of the source, it&#39;s hard to say whether Willett or the textbook is correct on the issues where they diverge, so I chalk those areas up to uncertainty amongst qualified experts.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Weigh-Less-Delicious-ebook/dp/B00CKUEVT4/">Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less</a> by Mollie Katzen and Walter Willett </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16969" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/81uHxs1J6pL._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> While the previous book is an excellent summary of the state of nutritional science, it&#39;s not a weight-loss book, and parsing it for weight-loss recommendations might take some effort. Fortunately, Katzen and Willett have translated the dietary recommendations into a specific plan for someone who wants both to eat healthier and lose weight.</p><p> The basic strategy of all weight-loss diets is caloric restriction. However, reducing calories increases the risk of missing out on essential nutrients, which is a particular risk of fad or crash diets. This book might be worthwhile if you want to lose some weight in as healthful a way as possible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Nutrition-MindTap-Course-List/dp/0357447514/">Understanding Nutrition</a> by Ellie Whitney and Sharon Rady Rolfes </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="848" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16970" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-848x1024.jpg 848w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/71mV2nVVNPL._SL1500_.jpg 1242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></figure></div><p> This was my favorite textbook. While the detailed explanations of the biochemistry of energy metabolism might be unnecessary for most people, I love explanations that go deeper into the science.</p><p> One thing I didn&#39;t know, for instance, was that many of the body&#39;s cells rely on glucose for energy, but the body cannot make glucose from fat (it can make glucose from protein). Fat burning proceeds during low-intensity daily activity, but most physical activity requires some glucose for performance. This was one of many warnings against extremely low-carb diets I read in the more “official” sources I read for the month.</p><p> Interestingly, although the style and specific content covered differed between the textbooks I read, the recommendations for health in both textbooks were practically identical. I suspect this is because both are drawing on the same original source, rather than the authors independently arriving at the same conclusion. It doesn&#39;t mean the advice is without controversy, but it was at least satisfying to note there does appear to be some nutritional orthodoxy that one can point to as being consistent.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Academy-Nutrition-Dietetics-Complete-Guide/dp/0544520580/">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Complete Food &amp; Nutrition Guide</a> by Roberta L.

I jokingly referred to it as “the phone book,” owing to its heft, as I lugged it between my home and office. Like a phone book, it was also far from the most exciting read. I can&#39;t fault the author here, as it&#39;s meant to be a reference book, so I don&#39;t believe anyone was expecting it to be read cover-to-cover. But, that was exactly what I did, and I&#39;m glad I made it through.</p><p> This book covers nearly any possible question you might have about food, ranging from the safety of artificial sweeteners to the proper handling of poultry, different types of eating disorders to the efficacy of sports supplements.

At its heart, I basically agree with Pollan&#39;s advice and overall philosophy: eat real food, eat more plants, eat in moderation, and focus on cooking good food rather than consuming ultra-processed junk.</p><p> However, after reading many other books, I feel some of Pollan&#39;s tirades miss the mark. He spends a lot of time writing about how the “lipid hypothesis” that nutritionists recommended for years has been debunked. But then he casually flips back and forth between correctly rejecting the idea that all fat is bad and presenting the false idea that nutritional science has decided that saturated fats aren&#39;t worth worrying about (the consensus is that they are).</p><p> Similarly, Pollan gives a lot of space to both Gary Taubes and T. Colin Campbell. Taubes&#39; insistence that sugar is the cause of the obesity epidemic (as opposed to excess calorie consumption, in general) is <a href="https://sigmanutrition.com/episode429/">probably false</a> . Campbell&#39;s advocacy of a strict vegetarian diet, in turn, is probably based on <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">some shaky science</a> .</p><p> That said, Pollan articulates better than anyone else I read the philosophy of eating, not just to optimize nutrition, but for living better. That means cooking real food, using whole ingredients with less processing, and trusting more traditional diets rather than scientifically engineered concoctions.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/">What I Learned (and Unlearned) Reading 10 Books on Nutrition</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/13/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-reading-10-books-on-nutrition/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Food – Opening Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 07 Jan 2025 03:01:32 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16906 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m writing this on the first day of the fourth month in my year-long foundations project.

Food provides the energy we use to live. It is a bond with our friends and family. It&#39;s a connection to our culture. And it&#39;s a source of enjoyment and pleasure. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16910" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/08-Food-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><p> Still, for many of us, our foundation of food is problematic. Untethered from good health and communal traditions, our eating behaviors are making us sick and lonely. We don&#39;t have time to cook and sit together for meals, and at the same time, obesity rates have skyrocketed.</p><p> Fixing this problem, even in one&#39;s own life, isn&#39;t easy. Just as it is evident we don&#39;t eat healthy on the whole, it is just as evident that the failure to eat healthy isn&#39;t any individual&#39;s “fault.” Our food environment has changed dramatically, and unconscious hormonal and neural signals that served our ancestors well now makes us sick.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Food History</h2><p> My own relationship with food is atypical. I had severe allergies to nuts and dairy as a child. Fortunately, I outgrew the dairy allergy, but it meant that my childhood was always centered around caution and avoidance of foods that were utterly normal to other people. I rarely had candy at Halloween, for instance, because few treats were safe. I was often the kid who brought a separate snack to a party because I didn&#39;t want to get sick.</p><p> As a teenager, I was persuaded that eating a vegetarian diet was the path to health. I read a few books, notably, <a href="https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-china-study-the-most-comprehensive-study-of-nutrition-ever-conducted-and-the-startling-implications-for-diet-weight-loss-and-long-term-health/">The China Study</a> , which made the argument that dropping animal products was a reliable path to healthy eating. Perhaps because of my early childhood experiences with food avoidance, I didn&#39;t find it difficult to stick to long-term.</p><p> I&#39;m more doubtful of the health benefits of veganism than I was as a teenager, but I still think they have a valid argument for both ethical and environmental reasons. Today, I eat fish, eggs and dairy, and I try not to be overly paranoid about other animal products in my food, consumed in small amounts—the way I see it, some degree of vegetarianism is probably better on the whole, but it&#39;s easy go overboard and be annoying to others regarding dietary restrictions.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t advocate for anyone to start eating as I do unless they are already interested in it. Most people fail to sustain extreme dietary restrictions, and it&#39;s not at all clear that meat ought to be the first thing to drop if you are simply trying to improve the health quality of your diet. Still, I tend to think a whole-food pescatarian diet is pretty healthy, so given that this is already the status quo for me, I don&#39;t feel compelled to make a shift to start eating more meat.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Food Falters</h2><p> Despite what may seem to many to be an already fairly restrictive diet, I can&#39;t say in all honesty that my eating patterns are maximally healthy. It&#39;s still possible to overeat, and plenty of junk food is totally vegan.</p><p> When I was in my early twenties, I could eat whatever I wanted without gaining any weight. Indeed, since I was often lifting weights, trying to gain weight was more frequently my challenge—I had to set an intention to try to put on pounds.</p><p> But, as I reached my late twenties, this was no longer true. Absent any special effort, I started to gain weight. At my peak, I weighed at least 20 lbs. above my typical college-aged weight and probably 15 lbs. above my ideal weight.</p><p> The reasons I gained weight were probably the same as everyone: I ate too much. I ate out frequently. Work and parenting pressures meant less sleep and more stress. I didn&#39;t exercise with the same vigor as my twenty-year-old self.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Refocusing on Health</h2><p> When I began working on my fitness foundation three months ago, I was naturally drawn to getting a head start on the reading for nutrition, too.</p><p> Owing to the confusion surrounding nutritional advice, and my own history of being overly swayed by a somewhat ideological author&#39;s advice for eating, I wanted to stick more to the science—keeping my focus on higher quality books as rated by independent reviewers, as well as following sources that scrutinize a lot of the scientific details behind dietary guidance.</p><p> This background reading, in combination with my renewed exercise habits, has led to a general improvement in my eating patterns. I&#39;ve now lost about 10 lbs. from my peak weight, even though restricting my food intake wasn&#39;t a priority.</p><p> Some of the things I strived for in the past few months that helped with this goal include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Eating more fruits and vegetables.</strong></li><li> <strong>Switching refined carbohydrates for whole grains when possible.</strong></li><li> <strong>Packing a lunch for work rather than eating out.</strong></li><li> <strong>Eating a big breakfast.</strong></li><li> <strong>Controlling portions when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Not snacking after dinner has finished.</strong></li></ul><p> These recommendations, which came up in my readings, seem to have worked well without any explicit aim to restrict calories. My case is probably atypical, but I was pleased to see that simply trying to eat healthier foods and managing my appetite seemed to be enough to lose some weight, along with the significant increase in my physical activity since the first month of this project.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Plans for the Month Ahead</h2><p> Since I&#39;ve already made many of the shifts I had initially planned to eat healthier, my focus for this month is largely trying to formalize the changes I am already doing informally.</p><p> In particular, I think the habits I want to sustain long-term are less like my earlier forays into highly restrictive eating patterns, but more about planning and preparation. The things I want to ensure I do this month include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Buy enough healthy food at the grocery store, so it&#39;s always available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Make sure I have healthy options for packing lunches.</strong></li><li> <strong>Have healthy options for snacking/desserts.</strong></li></ul><p> My breakfasts, lunches and snacks tend to be fairly independent, so I have the most control over those. But I eat dinners with my family, and I usually have a lunch or two per week with people I work with. Similarly, there are often events, family gatherings, vacations and other situations where having complete control over what I eat is unrealistic.</p><p> Therefore, for those situations less under my control, the behaviors I want to cultivate are:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>尽可能选择更健康的选择。</strong></li><li> <strong>Opt for reasonable portion sizes when healthy options aren&#39;t available.</strong></li><li> <strong>Plan ahead to eat healthy food before going to a place where only unhealthy options are available, so portion control becomes easier to attain.</strong></li></ul><p> These are guidelines, not hard rules. I think if I can be 80-90% successful with them, the moments where I indulge won&#39;t matter so much. My goal isn&#39;t to restrict myself from enjoying food I really do want, but to make it so such indulgences don&#39;t detract from an overall healthy eating pattern.</p><p> Additionally, I am taking the step of tracking what I eat for the month. This step is a bit a tedious, especially given that I&#39;m not really concerned about my dietary quality at the moment. However, since I have this month to focus on food, I figured it would give me some insight into my eating patterns that might be useful when I&#39;m no longer focusing on food, specifically.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Non-Nutritional Goals for Eating Better</h2><p> At this point, it may sound like I&#39;m trying to become a health-obsessed dieting weirdo. And I admit, this is a real concern. While it&#39;s pretty clear the standard Western diet is incredibly unhealthy, it&#39;s also pretty clear that an obsession with healthy eating is probably not great for your mental health.</p><p> My ultimate goal for the month is to establish enough strong habits and default options that thinking about healthy eating isn&#39;t an issue—it&#39;s just what I do unthinkingly in most situations. But I also want to recognize those situations where health isn&#39;t my primary goal when eating. Noticing how my plans interfere with these non-nutritional goals is also important, because I want to make my habits sustainable, and I want to eat delicious food, too.</p><p> I want to be able to enjoy family gatherings, eat at restaurants and on vacation, enjoy a wide variety of delicious foods and not feel hungry throughout the day. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on these factors as well, because a maximally healthy diet that means eating monotonous, bland meals in isolation is something I neither want nor can sustain.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Want to Improve Your Foundation for This Month?</h2><p> I&#39;m going into a lot more detail on the lessons I&#39;m gathering from my research in the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations course</a> . But anyone who wants to improve how they eat is welcome to join me, informally, for this month&#39;s project.</p><p> The habit we&#39;re cultivating this month is flexible food planning. This simply means taking steps to shape your food environment, from buying healthier food at the grocery store to planning healthier meals. If you&#39;re really serious about changing your diet, you&#39;re also welcome to go all the way to fully planning your meals a week in advance and tracking your calories, but this additional step is not necessary for most people to make improvements. Even little things like dropping sugary drinks or adding more vegetables to your plate are still worth doing.</p><p> At the end of the month, I&#39;ll share notes from the books I read, as well as provide an update of how my month focused on food went.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/">Food – Opening Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/01/06/food-opening-update/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Money – Month-End Update</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:02:21 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16886 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m now rounding out the third month in my year-long project to improve my foundations.

I’m working three months ahead of the publication of these posts to make it easier to produce all the content for my Foundations course."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p><p> This month&#39;s focus was money. In particular, the keystone habit I asked students of <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">my course</a> to work on this month was setting up a system to track their expenses and reviewing it at least monthly.</p><p> Monthly expense tracking has been a habit of mine for almost two decades, so my personal challenge this month was to:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Improve my tracking.</strong> Prior to this month, my wife and I tracked dozens of different spending categories. We reorganized our system so we have main categories and subcategories, making it easy to see how much we spend on “big picture” items while also having enough detail that we can get specific in any particular area (for instance, how much of our food costs is due to eating out versus groceries?)</li><li> <strong>Get term life insurance.</strong> I applied for term life insurance for myself. I decided to get a policy that would cover our outstanding mortgage balance, since the other financial assets I have should be enough to cover any other expenses.</li><li> <strong>Rebalance my assets.</strong> This was a concern of mine as I don&#39;t feel my asset allocation so far has been done in a particularly principled way. However, reading dozens of books (including the better part of a 1000-page textbook on investing) didn&#39;t really persuade me to change my strategy much. I probably want to start shifting some of my assets into a bond index, but I&#39;d rather do that with newer savings rather than rebalancing the investments I already have. I still think, given my age and work flexibility, an 80-90 percent equity portfolio is the way to go. </li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Foundations Conversation: Month 3 Update - Money" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbJPBlC9cpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p> Overall, my money foundation month was more about deepening my knowledge base rather than radically changing my habits. Going in, I felt pretty good about my overall savings levels, investment strategy and money management in general, but it was nice to dig a bit deeper into this topic and affirm some of my long-standing commitments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Planning for My Financial Future</h2><p> Another step I took this month was to do some explicit calculations of my financial goals. I ran a few scenarios looking at what I can expect long-term under different future conditions based on my current assets.</p><p> This exercise helped me see what my financial position would be if I tried to retire immediately, in ten years, or not until I&#39;m in my seventies. I don&#39;t plan on stopping work anytime soon, but sometimes misfortune strikes and we&#39;re not given that choice. It was a useful exercise for seeing how my financial foundation could support my family in the case that my business failed or I somehow became incapable of earning a similar income.</p><p> This kind of analysis of net worth and retirement goals is not complicated to do, but I had never actually done it before.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Feeling Good About Money</h2><p> Another thing this month helped me with was with feeling better about my money, in general. For years, I have been comfortably saving more than I was spending, so I didn&#39;t think much about money at all. But my wife and I bought a house two years ago, and the combined pressure of watching the investments we had for the down payment take a tumble, having a mortgage, and seeing interest rates rise<span id='easy-footnote-12-16886' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-16886' title="To the confused Americans, we got a 5-year variable-rate mortgage. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the default in the US, but it isn’t common here in Canada."><sup>12</sup></a></span> added some financial stress.</p><p> I don&#39;t say this as a complaint—I&#39;m acutely aware of how fortunate we are. But it was stressful, nonetheless.</p><p> Doing the work of comparing our actual spending to our current financial picture, including the variety of possible future scenarios for investment return, interest rates, and even my ability to work and continue this business, made me a lot more comfortable about our plans going forward 。 While there&#39;s a stereotype of the person who doesn&#39;t look at their bank accounts to avoid financial anxiety, I think I tend to be the opposite. If I can&#39;t see what my goals are and whether or not I&#39;m reaching them, I get more anxious about spending, especially when things like my mortgage payments jump up considerably.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Being Committed to the Strategy</h2><p> The other lesson I took from my extensive reading this month was the importance of emotional resolve in one&#39;s financial plan. It&#39;s relatively easy to describe an investing strategy, but it seems it&#39;s much harder to commit to a plan when it&#39;s losing money in the short-term, even if it is a good strategy in the long-term.</p><p> I decided not to alter my asset allocation considerably, despite all my reading. One reason for this was simply that I feel like the informational bar for making changes to your investing strategy needs to be relatively high, otherwise there&#39;s a temptation to panic when the market crashes, or chase winners when the market is irrationally high. In this sense, I feel like a relatively simple strategy with fewer funds and choices is probably better for me, even if it isn&#39;t completely optimal from a theoretical perspective. Simplicity is easier to commit to intellectually and stick to in practice even when it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s paying off. It&#39;s hard to have the discipline to rebalance your portfolio *into* the “losers” year after year to stay consistent with a strategy, so having fewer items to rebalance seems valuable  from a behavioral standpoint.</p><p> Time will tell whether my particular choices were correct, but I have become more convinced that commitment matters more than cleverness when it comes to managing investments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Updates to Fitness and Productivity</h2><p> In addition to working on my money this month, I also sustained my previous two foundations, fitness and productivity.</p><p> Fitness continued to go well. I&#39;ve now had my third month where I haven&#39;t missed a daily workout, although a couple of those defaulted to a low-intensity stretch. I now feel like my cardiovascular fitness is about as good as it&#39;s ever been. I&#39;m still rebuilding my strength to get to my past peak of about 5 years ago, but I haven&#39;t plateaued yet.</p><p> I&#39;m also about 10 lbs. lighter than when I began three months ago. Losing weight wasn&#39;t an initial goal, but it&#39;s been a nice perk.</p><p> The productivity system I initially set up continues, although I still feel like there are a few kinks that need ironing out. I think being more consistent about the weekly and daily reviews, especially the collaborative ones with my wife at the end of the week, are essential for getting the system to work smoothly.</p><p> Still, I feel like productivity was already a solid foundation for me, so this is more of an effort to smooth off some remaining rough edges.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> With the first quarter of the year-long project concluding, I&#39;m feeling good about going into the next nine months. Next month focuses on food—I&#39;ll share my opening update for that one next week!</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/">Money – Month-End Update</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/31/money-month-end/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Insights from Ten Useful Books on Money</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:24:48 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=16859 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Want to be better with money?

This month&#39;s focus was money. You can also see my notes on books from the previous two months covering <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/10/22/what-i-learned-about-getting-in-shape-after-reading-13-books-this-month/">fitness</a> and <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/11/19/10-important-books-productivity/">productivity</a> .</p><p> Next week, I&#39;ll share some of the steps my wife and I took this month to improve our family&#39;s financial situation. But first, I want to share some notes from the ten books on finances and money management I read this month.</p><p> I&#39;m far from an expert in finance, but of all the foundations I&#39;m covering, it&#39;s one of the few where I actually have some formal training—my university degree is from the business school at University of Manitoba, and I also took several economics courses during the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> . Thus, a lot of my reading this month was a refresher rather than a first pass. Still, it can be helpful to be reminded of things we have learned before, especially if we want to implement them consistently in our behavior.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The 1-Minute Summary of What I Learned</h2><p> Here&#39;s a brief overview of the major lessons from this month&#39;s readings:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Being rich is different from looking rich.</strong> The easiest way to find yourself broke on a high income is to try to appear like you have a lot of money.</li><li> <strong>You can&#39;t beat the market.</strong> Virtually all investors are better off with simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index-investing.asp">index investing</a> than paying a professional portfolio manager.</li><li> <strong>Successful investing is more about courage than brains.</strong> Sticking to a strategy—even when it looks like you&#39;re losing money—is incredibly hard. Most investors chase past winners and end up lowering their returns, since those investments that did well in the recent past tend to be somewhat overvalued compared to the recent “losers.”</li><li> <strong>The financial industry is full of scams and predatory behavior.</strong> While agency issues exist in all fields, professional financial advising has one of the worst track records when it comes to balancing profit motives with fiduciary duty to clients.</li><li> <strong>Practice eclipses theory in investing.</strong> Empirically, investing has been solved. Theoretically, finance is still poorly understood, and many of the most widely-used models don&#39;t neatly line up with empirical tests.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Notes on the Ten Books I Read</h2><p> My favorite book of the month was Burton Malkiel&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324035439/">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a> .

The authors gathered a treasure trove on all sorts of behaviors associated with being wealthy, down to the amount rich people spend on watches and which brands of cars they drive.</p><p> To broadly summarize, typical millionaires don&#39;t look especially rich. They often live in modest homes in modest neighborhoods and don&#39;t spend a lot of money, despite having healthy earnings. That&#39;s why they&#39;re rich.</p><p> My major annoyance with this book is that the authors invented two income-adjusted categories of individuals: Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW) and Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAW). These are people who have more or less wealth, respectively, than would be expected given their income. The authors spend much of the book continually expressing amazement at what a frugal bunch of people these PAWs are.</p><p> But this is tautologically true! If you control for income, someone with a lot of wealth <em>necessarily</em> spends less money than they could. The authors found that frugality matters because they defined their investigation so it was the only thing that <em>could</em> matter.<span id='easy-footnote-13-16859' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/12/17/10-books-money/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-16859' title="Of course, if you consider capital appreciation separately from income, it’s always possible that someone could have more wealth simply by having much better investments (or fewer losses). However, this isn’t the crux of the book (which doesn’t spend much time discussing investing itself) so the point still stands."><sup>13</sup></a></span></p><p> Savings rates definitely matter to wealth. But the authors&#39; sleight of hand makes it look as though it&#39;s the <em>only</em> thing that matters—ignoring a person&#39;s income. This is a useful trick if you want to moralize about wasteful consumption, but perhaps less honest if you&#39;re trying to ask why some people have more money than others.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/">Your Money or Your Life</a> by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="669" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-669x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16863" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-669x1024.jpg 669w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_-768x1176.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/71AL7FJJw3L._SL1500_.jpg 980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></figure></div><p> A classic from the “financial independence” side of personal finance advice, I found this book helpful not for any grand insight it offered, but for its subtle reframing of how to think about money.</p><p> Most of us measure our spending in terms of dollars and cents. Robin and Dominguez, in contrast, argue that we ought to calculate our “true” wage (meaning the amount we earn minus any costs associated with our employment, such as cars for commuting, lunches at the office or clothing we wear to work) and then use that to determine how many hours and minutes everything we buy costs us. Money is a renewable resource, but our time is not—knowing how much of our life&#39;s energy we spend when we buy things can be a powerful way to curb spending.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> by Ramit Sethi </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="685" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-685x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16864" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-685x1024.jpg 685w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-201x300.jpg 201w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_-768x1149.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81c9SSbG3OL._SL1500_.jpg 1003w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></figure></div><p> I&#39;ve known Ramit for decades. Indeed, I have an email he sent me, introducing himself, when we were both still skinny, college-aged bloggers. Now he has a NYT bestselling book, a multimillion-dollar business empire and a Netflix show.</p><p> I read the first edition of Ramit&#39;s book when it came out over a decade ago, and I still think it&#39;s one of the best. Ramit is both specific and practical in his advice, giving concrete details for how to automate your savings, which banks to use, what to invest in and how to negotiate a better salary.</p><p> But beyond the advice, I think what I enjoy most about Ramit&#39;s perspective is that he manages to advocate for financial prudence without falling into the “spending is evil” trap so common in personal finance literature. While it&#39;s true that most Westerners ought to spend less and save more, if you read too many personal finance books, you might forget that you can use money to make your life better and that obsessive penny-pinching isn&#39;t the only way to live 。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Path-Wealth-financial-independence/dp/1533667926/">The Simple Path to Wealth</a> by JL Collins </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-663x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16865" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_-768x1187.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6162e7L9gOL._SL1360_.jpg 880w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></figure></div><p> Collins takes the philosophy of index investing—that low-cost, simple portfolios beat actively managed, complex investments—to an extreme. He argues that you pretty much only need to put your money into one fund: Vanguard&#39;s total stock market portfolio.</p><p> This makes Collins a bit of a contrarian from most portfolio management perspectives. Investing 100% in stocks is generally considered a very risky portfolio. Perhaps the popularity of this strategy is simply due to the US&#39;s excellent bull market run since the Great Recession.</p><p> However, I can see the advantages of simplicity, even if it&#39;s suboptimal from the point of view of modern portfolio theory. A simpler investment has fewer traps to catch yourself in. Complicated investment schemes require you to regularly rebalance your portfolio and make it more likely for investors to try to time the market or chase supposedly superior asset classes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unconventional-Success-Fundamental-Approach-Investment-ebook/dp/B000FCKBT8?">Unconventional Success</a> by David Swensen </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="674" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-674x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16866" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-674x1024.jpg 674w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_-768x1167.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/81JDNQSzi2L._SL1500_.jpg 987w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></figure></div><p> Swensen is a legendary figure in investing circles. Running Yale&#39;s endowment fund, he regularly returned better-than-market averages. In doing so, he also flipped the conventional wisdom on how to properly manage such funds on its head—arguing that the truly long-term viewpoint of endowment funds should be tilted more towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equities</a> than was traditionally considered appropriate.</p><p> While Swensen does give investing advice, the most interesting part of this book is the numerous industry stories about ways Wall Street screws over retail investors. He devotes considerable time to documenting the various scandals ranging from outright fraud to legal-but-unethical practices that pit profit motive against fiduciary duty. Sadly, it seems profit wins nearly every time.</p><p> The only piece of advice Swensen gave that diverges from other sources is his emphasis on a relatively high degree of diversification between asset classes. In this sense, he takes the opposite approach to Collins by emphasizing a mixture of US and global equities, US treasury bonds, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp">TIPS</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp">REITs</a> rather than going all-in on a single fund.</p><p> I found Swensen&#39;s approach intellectually satisfying, but his method also requires a fair degree of rebalancing to keep the portfolio strategy consistent, which can be difficult for an average investor to sustain behaviorally and can potentially incur capital gains taxes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681/">The Psychology of Money</a> by Morgan Housel </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="662" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-662x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16867" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-662x1024.jpg 662w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_-768x1188.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/811QIj6h0L._SL1500_.jpg 970w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></figure></div><p> This was fun to listen to as an audiobook. Housel is an excellent writer. He weaves together fascinating stories about our all-too-human failings with money and ties them to universal principles of sound money management.</p><p> Perhaps my favorite anecdote from the book was the amount by which people underrate compound interest. Warren Buffett is rich, having over $140 billion. He&#39;s a good investor, making roughly 20% annualized returns. But—and this fact is less often emphasized—he is also <em>really</em> old. Starting at age 10, he has been seriously investing for 84 years!</p><p> Housel calculates that if Buffett had started investing at 30 and retired at 65, his final net worth would be a little over $11 million (with an <em>m</em> , not a <em>b</em> ), even including his impressive return rate.

He launched The Vanguard Group and pioneered the practice of index investing. Today, an investor can match the return rate of the entire stock market for less than a tenth of a percentage point in fees every year.</p><p> This book summarizes Bogle&#39;s case for index investing, drawing on extensive expert testimony explaining why buying shares in the entire stock or bond market and simply holding them regardless of market movements is the correct investment strategy for most investors.</p><p> Bogle&#39;s advice is simple, but it&#39;s far from simplistic. The advice to put your money in index funds is nearly universal among academics, and it&#39;s similarly common among professional money managers (at least when they&#39;re not trying to sell you a specific product they may profit from).</p><p> Bogle is contrarian in his focus on only domestic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">securities</a> and his dismissal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund">ETFs</a> . I tend to think some international diversification is prudent (although higher fees need to be accounted for), and that ETFs are in some ways a better investing vehicle than traditional mutual funds (although it depends on the exact fund). Those two points excepted, I agreed with virtually everything Bogle had to say about where to put your money.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1427769907?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title">Personal Financial Planning: Theory and Practice</a> by Michael Dalton and James Dalton </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="394" height="500" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16869" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L.jpg 394w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51dljNSP-L-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></figure></div><p> This textbook was a whopper.
