class="wp-block-heading"><strong>流：无聊和沮丧之间</strong></h2><p>已故的心理学家Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi开创了<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">流程</a>的概念，以在精神挑战和有意义的任务中定义令人愉悦的吸收状态。   学习需要集中精力，并有可能具有很大的意义，这两种都需要产生流量状态。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="800" height="600"

在等待钟声示意演讲终于结束时，不断地瞥了一眼教室时钟。尽管努力，但在没有进步的情况下，就会发生挫败感。当我们努力工作但感到完全卡住时，它会发生。 </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>流程很重要，因为如果学习的乐趣始终超过痛苦，我们只会学习学习的工作。</strong></p></blockquote><p>一个学习项目可能具有很高的外部奖励（更好的工作，健康或关系），甚至延迟了内在的奖励（满意，骄傲，新爱好）。但是，如果它的时刻经历是高度负面的，那么面对诱人的低成本替代品（例如游戏或社交媒体），将很难维持。</p><p>相反，如果学习经验令人愉悦（或至少不是太不愉快），那么您将能够维持更长的时间。这是Duolingo等工具背后的秘密，它比大多数替代方法更有趣地学习语言。<span id='easy-footnote-1-17186' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a

class="wp-block-heading"><strong>如何流动</strong></h2><p>您如何在学习中创建和维持流动状态？   答案很简单：当任务<strong>不太硬</strong>（挫败感）而<strong>不是太容易</strong>（无聊）时，会发生流动。再加上这一<strong>清晰而明显的进步标记，</strong>甚至表面上平凡的活动也可能会令人信服。</p><p>这就是游戏设计师想要创建引人注目的游戏时所做的：设定正确的难度并创建持续的进度标记以维持参与度。</p><p>可以完全优化游戏。但是，学习项目至少有效的项目也必须旨在获取您实际需要的知识。其他目的通常对您如何最大程度地提高学习中的流程有限制。</p><p>但是，假设您有学习的理由比简单地填补时间更有说服力，那么我们不需要像视频游戏那样吸引人的学习来完成它。我们需要做的就是确保它<em>足够</em>引人注目，以便我们没有一致的工作难以进行。</p><p>通常，您可以使用三种工具来改善学习项目中的流程：</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>流动增强器＃1：使无聊的零件更具吸引力</strong></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Flow-missing-step1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17207" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Flow-missing-step1.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Flow-missing-step1-300x225.jpg 300w,

/></figure></div><p>无聊是一种失败的流动方式。如果您在阅读一本乏味的教科书时曾经被卡住，并且在重新阅读相同的段落时发现自己正在脱落，那么您已经看到了如何无聊的学习。</p><p>找到更具表现力的讲师或更好的作者阅读是一种解决方案。但是，即使您无法更改材料，也可以通过更改阅读时使用的技术来使它们更具吸引力。</p><p>例如，通过保留一堆索引卡并编写一些符号点来汇总每页后，您可以进行完全被动的活动，并将其变成更活跃的活动。这有助于学习，但也使活动本身减少了无聊。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>流动增强器＃2：使令人沮丧的部分更容易</strong></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Flow-missing-step2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17208" style="width:450px"

/></figure></div><p>挫败感是另一种失败方式。当您处理超出当前技能水平的事情时，就会发生这种情况，因此您会遇到来自环境的频繁负面反馈信号。</p><p>尽管在学习项目中几乎不可避免地有些挫败感，但学习并不是学习的必要情绪。我们越能减少努力的挫败感，我们就越愉快地学习，而无需牺牲效力。</p><p>例如，如果您正在解决一系列问题和解决方案，则可以动态调整难度级别以保持挑战，但不要令人沮丧。如果您无法单独解决问题，请尝试提示解决问题。如果您不能这样做，请尝试省略解决方案的一个步骤之一，看看是否可以填写。如果您不能这样做，请尝试在阅读时解释自己的解决方案。通过将难度向下调整到具有挑战性但可行的地方，您可以增加流量，减少挫败感并使坚持工作更容易。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>流动增强剂＃3：使进度更明显</strong></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600"

/></figure></div><p>除了选择正确的难度之外，它还有助于将您的学习分解为可以稳步进步的小型单位。然后在您的学习工作中取得显着的进步。</p><p>通过为您提供一个不断增加的柜台，可以显示“学到的卡片”，以便您可以观察前进的进度。但是您可以为几乎所有与进度相关的变量做到这一点：</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>解决的问题数量。</li><li>页面阅读。</li><li>制作草图。</li><li>练习完成了。</li><li>排练进行。</li></ul><p>选择一个始终改善的变量（挫折是<a

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>预计我流行的课程<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/rapidlearner/">Rapid Learner</a>的新课程，我将分享一个四部分的课程系列，介绍如何创建成功的学习项目。在第一堂课中，我区分了<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/04/06/start-projects-you-finish/">项目完成者和项目启动器</a>之间的关键差异。</p><p>今天，我想讨论如何使您开展的项目有效。您如何确保您从事的​​项目实际上可以帮助您在试图变得更好的事情上变得更好？</p><p>为了成功地进行改进，我们需要两种类型的知识：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>了解领域</strong>。在西班牙语中，这包括“ agua”和“ estar”和“ ser。”之间的差异。在编程中，变量和常数之间的差异。在微积分中，如何采用衍生物。</li><li><strong>了解域的组织方式</strong>。学习西班牙语需要学习词汇，语法和发音。学习编程需要记住语法，并具有每条代码所做的事情的心理模型。学习微积分需要记住转型规则，并开发有关变化率的空间直觉。</li></ol><p>元学习是第二种知识。它是您用于计划您打算学习的域的“地图”。而且，就像在实际导航中一样，当您拥有一张好的地图时，您不太可能漫无目的地漫步到达目的地。</p><p>为了成功创建此地图，要牢记三个主要问题：</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>问题1：其他人如何绘制地图？</strong> </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Puzzle.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17181" style="width:450px"

href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2012.00504.x">自举问题</a>。学习和元学习是交织在一起的，因此我们对一个主题的了解越少，我们对如何组织该主题的了解越少。   这导致了我们的第一个原则：在进行任何新的学习项目之前，<strong>请尝试找出其他人如何组织学习的努力。</strong>这些人在技能，知识和实践中认为是什么？</p><p>在学校教授的技能吗？如果是这样，人们如何组织课程？它是在书籍，课程或学徒计划中教授的吗？这些通常如何进行？</p><p>幸运的是，这里的研究变得容易得多。 Google和最近的LLM工具（例如ChatGpt）可以提供理解新主题的起点。现在，您只需单击几下即可浏览专家如何分解一个主题。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>问题2：必须获取哪些事实，概念和程序？</strong> </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Skill-facts.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17182"

/></figure></div><p>一旦有了粗糙的地图，就该填写细节了。<strong>所有学习均由三种主要类型的知识的一些基本“原子”组成</strong>：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>事实</strong>- 需要记住的事实。单词，术语，公式，日期，术语。</li><li><strong>概念</strong>- 需要理解的概念。原理，思想，叙述，解释。</li><li><strong>程序</strong>- 需要执行的任务。方法，步骤，动作，技术。</li></ol><p>这适用于跨字段。学习西班牙语分解为事实（词汇），概念（例如Estar/Ser之间的差异）和程序（例如语法和发音）。学习编程分为事实（例如语法），概念（设计模式）和程序（例如如何编写循环）。学习微积分具有事实（例如，余弦是正弦的衍生物），概念（例如限制是什么）和程序（例如链条规则）。</p><p>该框架将原本无定的改进过程转化为待办事项清单。要学习一项技能，您只需要执行对学习每种知识的技术，例如事实记忆，概念的解释以及程序实践。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>问题3：需要哪些微调和反馈？</strong> </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600"

- 看起来直截了当的道路可能出乎意料地是死胡同。似乎是一个简单的概念或过程可能会掩盖巨大的隐性知识和直觉。</p><p>如果您学习这些“原子”的方式与他们在实际技能和情况中相结合的方式不符，那么只需检查待办事项清单上的项目就会适得其反。因此，成功学习的过程需要不断重写地图并重新安置待办事项列表。您会学到一些，看看什么有效，什么不起作用，然后相应地调整您的方法。</p><p>这意味着良好的学习项目需要并行两个活动：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>通过您确定的学习“原子”进行<strong>训练</strong>。这意味着阅读书籍，记住术语，实践程序并理解基本概念。</li><li><strong>直接练习</strong>两者都可以测试您的学习努力与现实相匹配，并以有用的方式整合和结合“原子”。这包括解决问题，编写代码或使用语言进行交流。直接实践意味着将您学习的技能应用于现实生活。</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>将所有这些融合在一起</strong></h2><p>最终结果是一个既实用又灵活的学习项目。</p><p>实用，因为它基于专家理解如何组织技能或主题的理解，并且因为它已从模糊的“改进”概念中分解为特定的事实，概念和程序。</p><p>灵活，因为通过将钻头结合起来以掌握原子与进行直接练习以测试地图，您可以确保您可以对项目进行任何必要的更改，以便这些原子成功地将其结合成真实的技能。</p><p>当然，这个过程比我在一课中可以解释的要多。这是发展我完整的六周课程<a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/rapidlearner/">快速学习者的</a>主要动力。教授元学习的艺术和科学，本课程将指导您设计如何掌握您关心的任何技能或主题的项目。我将在星期一发送注册信息。在下一课中，我想从元学习到生产力。毕竟，计划只是纸。有效的学习意味着执行 - 您如何从一个有伟大计划的人转到一贯完成工作的人？</p><p>第<a

闭上眼睛太少是荣誉的徽章，表明了我们的职业道德和坚定主义。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000"

/></figure></div><p>最近，关于睡眠的流行讨论已经开始分配其应有的重要性。即便如此，文化也会缓慢变化。当我与朋友讨论这个基础清单时，当我建议整整一个月专注于睡眠更好时，其中一个给了我一个古怪的外观。锻炼，当然。但是睡觉呢？</p><p>尽管最近关注，但睡眠仍然被低估为身体健康，积极情绪，生产力和全方位幸福感的驱动力。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我的睡眠（或缺乏睡眠）</h2><p>对我个人而言，睡眠是最难的基础之一。其中的大部分是由于是两个小孩的父亲，尽管他们很可爱，但他们并不总是有利于每晚八个不间断的小时。</p><p>我典型的睡眠常规还不错。我通常在晚上9:30至10:00之间上床睡觉，然后在上午5:30至6:00之间醒来。在没有中断的日子里，这可能接近我身体实际需要的睡眠量。在极少数凌晨6:00时睡觉的情况下，我通常在6:30至7:00 AM之间自发醒来。  我面临的挑战不是我的典型睡眠程序，而是几个夜晚是非典型的。虽然我的两个孩子（不是5和2）整夜都睡着，但其中至少有一个在5:30之前醒来，大约是50％。</p><p>有时，这只是一个快速的中断，不会影响我的睡眠。在其他情况下，中断变成了早期的唤醒。例如，我两岁的孩子在上个月的大部分时间里几乎每天凌晨4:00或4:30醒来。看来我们已经按照正常的时间表使她退缩，但是旅行，感冒或其他次要变化可以使我们回到不幸的睡眠节奏中。</p><p>当睡眠不足时，我的功能也很差。有些人似乎需要更多的睡眠才能发挥最佳作用，而另一些人可以在4-6个小时的情况下通过，而不会打扰他们。我肯定是在以前的小组中，在生孩子之前，我几乎每天晚上都有八个小时的睡眠。</p><p>不过，我的睡眠状况肯定会更糟。我没有失眠的问题 - 当我躺下时，我很少需要超过5-10分钟的时间入睡，而且晚上很少醒来几分钟以上。我也是一个很棒的尿布，如果需要的话，我什至可以入睡大约十分钟。据我所知，我也没有与睡眠有关的任何健康问题，这对许多人来说可能是如此令人沮丧。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我改善睡眠的计划</h2><p>在本月之前，我注意到我对我是否能够做任何改善睡眠的事情感到有些悲观。我和我的妻子对行为策略非常精通，以使孩子们更好地入睡（持续的就寝时间，唤醒灯，舒适等），我已经遵循很多建议来改善我的睡眠（一贯的睡前习惯，早起，早日睡觉，避免在一天后期避免咖啡因）。  生活中的一些问题不容易解决。幸运的是，由于孩子而导致的睡眠问题通常是暂时的，因此其中一些可能只是我必须等待一两年的事情。</p><p>但是，当我开始在本月进行一些提前阅读并进行了一些头脑风暴时，我意识到实际上有很多我可以做得更好的事情。最重要的是，即使我现在没有解决方案，也要严格记录我的睡眠，这可能指向我以前从未考虑过的解决方案。</p><p>因此，我将尝试改善本月的睡眠质量：</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>再次开始小睡</strong>。我曾经是几乎每天的尿布。二十至三十分钟通常足够，这可能会产生很大的不同。一旦我开始在办公室工作，我主要停止了这种习惯 - 即使我知道这对我的午睡而不是继续工作会更好，也从来没有一个舒适的地方伸展。我认为，如果我带上瑜伽垫和一个小枕头，我也许可以获得一个好的设置，使20分钟的小睡再次成为我一天的常规部分。</li><li><strong>早点睡觉更加一致，尤其是在睡个晚会之后</strong>。如果我睡不好，我最艰难的时期通常是在我感觉像僵尸时的下午4:00至6:00左右。到那时，我系统中的任何咖啡因都已经耗尽了，直到我通常睡觉的时间还要几个小时。但是，在晚上9点之前，我通常会非常机敏，即使我前一天晚上只睡了几个小时。我可能无法完全控制自己的睡眠，但是当我的睡眠不足时，我至少可以更早地睡前。</li><li><strong>每天切成一杯咖啡</strong>。我喝了很多咖啡。有时候，我什至全天喝三到四杯咖啡。由于我倾向于迅速入睡，因此咖啡因消费的研究支持的好处可能超过了成本，因此最初对我而言并不是重中之重。但是，在这个月，我将仅坚持我的早晨咖啡作为实验。</li><li><strong>晚上8:30之后避免电视或锻炼</strong>。当我开始今年一年的项目时，我是一个始终如一的凌晨6:00慢跑，但几个月的孩子干扰了睡眠，而我的妻子摔断了她的脚，将她的脚推开了，迫使我稍后锻炼。但是，我在晚上8:00之后发现锻炼使我难以入睡，因此我将尽最大努力将其保留。睡觉前我看不到很多电视，但是如果发生这种情况，我也会记下这一点。</li><li><strong>保留睡眠期刊</strong>。我将在本月睡觉时每天写一些简短的笔记，任何干扰以及我的整体心情。这是我的fitbit上的睡眠跟踪，应该可以帮助我对我的睡眠进行一些经验观察，而不仅仅是依靠我的记忆。</li></ol><p>总体而言，正如我认为这些变化的那样，我谨慎乐观。希望我能在晚上睡眠的基线质量（和数量），除非这一点，至少在整天的睡眠较差时，至少要在整天进行一些恢复性小睡，以提高我的功能。与往常一样，我会及时通知您在月底的情况！</p><p>帖子<a

</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy"

allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p>同样，在进行阅读时，我意识到自己的基础比我想象的要弱。我觉得我与家人和最好的朋友有着相当良好的密切联系。我也不擅长与人见面或进行低赌注的小话题和社交活动。但是，我不太擅长管理社会世界的外围，我认为有“好朋友”的人每年只见一次或两次。</p><p>经过阅读，我还感到本月的最初重点，强调使我结识新朋友的活动有些放错了位置。取而代之的是，我认为我真正的弱点是向内的一层 - 所有我认识的人，但没有足够的努力来维持休闲的友谊。</p><p>在这一点上，很容易找出各种借口：我有好朋友，那么谁需要熟人？ （除了两个人的目的不同，这两个目的都是繁荣的。）作为父母，我太忙于有小孩的父母，无法像以前一样“闲逛”。 （除了从字面上看，这是真实的；如果有些事情对我们很重要，我们为此付出了时间。）我不喜欢单方面的努力来维持较弱的联系，我希望事情是自发的。 （除了生活中的其他任何东西之外，所有的良好习惯都需要一定的努力和系统。）</p><p>尽管存在这些障碍，但我希望与目前的外展更好。这个月是一个不错的开端，但是鉴于这里的工作发生了多年，几乎没有完成。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我这个月做了什么</h2><p>首先，我非常擅长于每周与新朋友一起参加某种活动。我去了几个语言见面，并在一个生日聚会上遇到了一些人。</p><p>进行一些研究以寻找活动的努力很有帮助。在过去的几年中，我觉得我经常错过机会不仅出于忙碌的方式进行社交，而且还因为我没有在雷达上保留机会，所以当我相对自由时，我没有任何潜在的活动可以尝试。</p><p>我还努力与一些老朋友共度时光。 I don&#39;t expect to go back to pre-kids levels of socializing, but here too the once-per-week threshold seems like a doable minimum.</p><p> Finally, I decided to make following up with friends and colleagues at regular intervals a more structured habit. Creating a list of people I know with recurring reminders to contact them and putting it in my productivity system nudges me to reach out to people. I&#39;m also putting birthdays and other events in the same list so I can keep track of those too, now that I no longer use social media.</p><p> The month wasn&#39;t perfect. As I write this, it is December. (I write these updates three months in advance to give my team and myself lead time in preparing the <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">course</a> .) My family and my in-laws visited, which meant this wasn&#39;t the ideal month to focus on outreach. But that hiccup aside, I&#39;m confident that I&#39;ll be able to sustain the roughly once-per-week habit in the coming months.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Plans for Ongoing Outreach</h2><p> With a weekly habit, one month really isn&#39;t long enough to make something routine. So I&#39;m going to need to consciously monitor and make an effort here for at least another few months.</p><p> Given my assessment of my weak point here, I&#39;m also modifying the keystone habit I&#39;m going to try to sustain: Instead of focusing on meeting new people, I&#39;m going to try to split my efforts evenly between trying activities with new people and sustaining existing friendships with people I don&#39;t interact with automatically.   One step I have not taken, but feel might be important, is joining or belonging to a more formal organization or group. Putnam&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Collapse-American-Community/dp/1982130849/">Bowling Alone</a> really sold me on the idea that there&#39;s a benefit to belonging to something beyond an informal circle of friends. I suspect this is something I&#39;ll revisit in the last foundation: service.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Updates to Previous Foundations</h2><p> Of course, my goal with this project isn&#39;t simply to focus on one habit for a month and then move on, but to sustain my commitments from all the previous months. Here are some updates for the previous five foundations:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>健康</strong>。 Still going strong. My running speed has improved, with my 10 km time getting down to 52 minutes. That&#39;s a major improvement over a few months ago when it was a challenge to run that distance in under an hour, and an even bigger improvement from before this project began when I hadn&#39;t run for more than 30 minutes in almost a decade.</li><li> <strong>Productivity</strong> . The system I reworked during the month is still holding, although I still struggle with keeping up with household chores. Still, the amount of things that slip my mind has dropped considerably, which means the system is doing its job even if I still don&#39;t have time to do everything I&#39;d like.</li><li><strong>钱</strong>。 Also solid. My term life insurance policy was approved, so I can finally check that box after applying for it months ago. I also started the process of setting up educational savings funds for my kids. Since it&#39;s December when I write this, I plan to do a bigger annual review in January as well.</li><li><strong>食物</strong>。 There was some predictable backsliding here during the holiday season. I was fine with this, but it will be important to get back to my defaults next month. I&#39;m now about 15 lbs. lighter than my weight at the start of my project, which is probably close to my ideal weight, so at this point I&#39;m trying to avoid both over- and under-eating, especially as I&#39;ve been exercising more.</li><li><strong>阅读</strong>。 With eight books read this month, I&#39;m mostly back to my normal reading routine. This month was a little lighter than usual, but the holidays cut into work-related reading. Still, I fully expect to be on track to read 100+ books for this project by its end.</li></ol><p> That&#39;s it for this month.

This threshold explains why you can socialize frequently, yet still fail to make friends—if you don&#39;t have sustained opportunity to socialize with the same people over and over, many potential friendships drop off before they hit the 60+ hour threshold.</li><li> <strong>It&#39;s better to be interest <em>ed</em> than interest <em>ing</em> .</strong> People are egocentric. We like people who like us, who take an interest in our interests and who really want to listen.</li><li> <strong>Democracy itself may be at stake.</strong> Since the 1960s, community and civic life have withered from their post-WWII peak. This decay of social infrastructure may be a major reason for our collective distrust and polarization.</li></ol><p> Overall I found this topic much deeper than I had expected, leading to some personal realizations which I&#39;ll discuss next week. Now, some notes on each of the books I read…</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8 Books on Making Friends</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/8183227899/">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="659" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71vK0WVQ4rL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17134" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71vK0WVQ4rL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg 659w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71vK0WVQ4rL._SL1500_-193x300.jpg 193w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71vK0WVQ4rL._SL1500_-768x1193.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71vK0WVQ4rL._SL1500_.jpg 966w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></figure></div><p> Every once in awhile, a self-help book becomes so popular that it becomes a free-floating meme, detached from its actual content. Carnegie&#39;s classic belongs in that rare genre of books which you probably feel like you&#39;ve read—even if you haven&#39;t.</p><p> While the book has dozens of chapters articulating specific strategies for dealing with people, they all basically boil down to a simple observation: most people are egocentric. If you can adopt the other person&#39;s perspective, and give them what they genuinely want, you&#39;ll have smoother social interactions than if you focus directly on what you want.</p><p> The book definitely shows its age in a few places, such as a charming anecdote about a manager complimenting his secretary&#39;s appearance, but the advice needs few updates because human nature hasn&#39;t changed since Carnegie first wrote it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Friendship-Natural-History-Lydia-Denworth/dp/0393651541">Friendship</a> by Lydia Denworth </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61smhqFYiEL._SL1200_-678x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17135" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61smhqFYiEL._SL1200_-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61smhqFYiEL._SL1200_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61smhqFYiEL._SL1200_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61smhqFYiEL._SL1200_.jpg 795w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></figure></div><p> I enjoyed this wide-ranging book discussing the science of friendship. The topics covered are eclectic, so it&#39;s difficult to summarize adequately. Denworth&#39;s investigation of friendship ranges from in-depth discussion of monkey communities, to the health impacts of loneliness, to whether or not Facebook is good or bad for society.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supercommunicators-Unlock-Secret-Language-Connection/dp/0593243919/">Supercommunicators</a> by Charles Duhigg </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/811bzOshn5L._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17136" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/811bzOshn5L._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/811bzOshn5L._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/811bzOshn5L._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/811bzOshn5L._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> Duhigg, a journalist whose previous work includes bestsellers on habits and productivity, tackles social skills in <em>Supercommunicators</em> . The idea is drawn from the observation that some people are consistently better in their ability to make friends than others, and that this skill is learnable to some degree.</p><p> A central idea of this book is that essential communication depends on understanding what kind of conversation the other person wants to have and ensuring you match them in that desire. Duhigg argues for three broad types of conversations: practical (What are we going to do?), emotional (How do we feel about it?), and identity (Who are we?), and that attempts to dialogue often derail when people don&#39;t successfully synchronize this.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654/">Never Eat Alone</a> by Keith Ferrazzi </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="673" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51WIl9k2-L._SL1200_-673x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17137" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51WIl9k2-L._SL1200_-673x1024.jpg 673w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51WIl9k2-L._SL1200_-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51WIl9k2-L._SL1200_-768x1168.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51WIl9k2-L._SL1200_.jpg 789w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this book shortly after it came out in 2005. I think Ferrazzi does a good job of practically explaining how super-networkers, such as himself, manage to meet so many people and maintain so many relationships. One key insight I enjoyed revisiting was his explanation that relationships are muscles which strengthen through use, not bank accounts where favors can be saved up for a rainy day.</p><p> While I found this book useful, it&#39;s probably not the best book to persuade someone of the value of networking if they already find the practice off-putting. I think guides that focus on friendship and service are probably better to adopt as a mindset than the ambition-orientation that suffuses this book.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Should-Get-Together-Cultivating-Friendships/dp/1734379715">We Should Get Together</a> by Kat Vellos </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61bYNspKXDL._SL1360_-644x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17138" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61bYNspKXDL._SL1360_-644x1024.jpg 644w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61bYNspKXDL._SL1360_-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61bYNspKXDL._SL1360_-768x1222.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61bYNspKXDL._SL1360_.jpg 855w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></figure></div><p> Vellos writes about how hard it is to make friends in big cities. People are abundant, yet genuine connection is often rare and fleeting.   This book was interesting, although probably aimed more at an earlier chapter in my life when I was often newly in a big city with ample time for socializing but struggling with the revolving door of temporary friendships.</p><p> Still, I think Vellos addresses a genuine need for a lot of people, and her advice is practical and useful.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0143118757">Getting to Yes</a> by Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61vj08zXXjL._SL1200_-663x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17139" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61vj08zXXjL._SL1200_-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61vj08zXXjL._SL1200_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61vj08zXXjL._SL1200_-768x1186.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/61vj08zXXjL._SL1200_.jpg 777w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></figure></div><p> Negotiation is a central part of all relationships. From diplomatic conferences to deciding where to go for dinner, we&#39;re always in a delicate dance of conflicting interests and desires.   The authors argue that most people make the mistake of bargaining over positions, like hagglers at a street market who keep stating their “best price” until they either make a deal or walk away. The uncomfortable conflict this creates causes some people to go hard, trying to squeeze the other person at the risk of the relationship, or go soft, trying to accommodate at the risk of failing to get what you really want.</p><p> Instead, the authors suggest we should negotiate on principles, not positions. Separate the people from the problem; focus on your interests, not your position itself; look for options for mutual gain; and when you have to compromise, look for objective standards and principles to determine fairness.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Gathering-How-Meet-Matters/dp/1594634939">The Art of Gathering</a> by Priya Parker </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/81yOE-NKSFL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17140" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/81yOE-NKSFL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/81yOE-NKSFL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/81yOE-NKSFL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/81yOE-NKSFL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> A good book opens you to a new way of thinking. Parker&#39;s book definitely did that for me. Before reading this, not once had I ever considered hosting a dinner party or social event with the mindset Parker espouses.</p><p> Parker&#39;s key to throwing successful parties is to define a clear (and debatable) purpose and have everything tailored to that outcome. That means the venue, guest list and even the rules of the party (she thinks a good host should have and enforce them) should all work to achieve the gathering&#39;s stated purpose.</p><p> Definitely a must-read if you want to have an important event and aren&#39;t sure the right way to go about it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Collapse-American-Community/dp/1982130849/">Bowling Alone</a> by Robert Putnam </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71UQ4cMLjWL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17141" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71UQ4cMLjWL._SL1500_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71UQ4cMLjWL._SL1500_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71UQ4cMLjWL._SL1500_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71UQ4cMLjWL._SL1500_.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div><p> Civic participation and communal life in America have been declining for decades, and the decay in our social infrastructure is showing.  Armed with hundreds of charts and statistics, Putnam walks through various measures of social decline from club membership, church attendance, volunteerism, political activism, and even picnics. Across the board, people are spending less time connected to their community than they were during the heyday of communal life in the 1960s.</p><p> This decline is epitomized in the title of the book: at the time of its writing, more people than ever were bowling, but there were far fewer bowling <em>leagues</em> .<span id='easy-footnote-3-17132' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/03/18/8-books-on-making-friends/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-17132' title="Putnam himself notes that the term “bowling alone” should be taken with poetic license. People probably *are* bowling with friends. But with fewer leagues, these informal and spontaneous gatherings are not a substitute for the larger assembly of social capital created by bringing people from different walks of life together in organized leagues and clubs."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p><p> In this decline, Putnam sounds a warning about the health of American society. Places with lower measures of social capital have worse social outcomes: less civic participation, less trust in government, higher crime and worse health. Communal interaction builds generalized trust, which acts as a social lubricant making transacting with strangers easier and safer.<span id='easy-footnote-4-17132' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/03/18/8-books-on-making-friends/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-17132' title="As a side note, as I read this book shortly after the recent US election, it seems impossible not to connect Putnam’s words about the potential damage of declining social trust and the recent political climate."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p><p> Unfortunately, it hardly seems like we&#39;ve reached the nadir of Putnam&#39;s social capital decline. Putnam blaming the entertainment value of television for causing the decline in social gathering now seems almost quaint when we have always-on, algorithmically-mediated entertainment in our pockets at all times.</p><p> While the message may be a bit of a downer, I still found this book enormously useful in reshaping my perspective on socializing. There&#39;s value in belonging to communities, not merely circles of friends.

Ask These Four Questions First</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A lot of advice focuses on what to do, but advice focusing on what to quit is comparatively rare. Every path taken necessarily implies another path ignored, so the two must matter equally.</p><p> In some ways, choosing to quit is harder than choosing to take action. We all know we should exercise, read, meditate, socialize, work hard, spend time with family, and drink eight glasses of water every day. But when that list inevitably becomes unmanageable, it&#39;s hard to say what we ought to stop.</p><p> Another reason the importance of quitting is less often discussed is that worthwhile pursuits are often challenging, and it is tempting to surrender to early difficulties. “Never give up” is an unrealistic slogan, but it may serve us well in situations where we&#39;re tempted to give up on our dreams and watch Netflix instead.</p><p> Because we devote more time to thinking about projects we should undertake rather than those we should abandon, the latter tends to occur impulsively. We quit because we&#39;re tired, bored, or because something else seems more appealing.   I think this is a mistake. Thinking more deliberately about when to give up might improve our decisions more than simply choosing more tasks to add to our to-do list.</p><p> Here are four questions you can ask yourself to help make the decision.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. The past is done. Do the future benefits outweigh the future costs?</h2><p> It&#39;s often helpful to start with figuring out what an ideally rational person would do in your situation. If you could consult an oracle who never gets tired or frustrated, and could calculate the right decision, what would she tell you to do?</p><p> Oracles don&#39;t exist, so we&#39;ll have to settle for economic theory. A key concept is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk costs</a> . This is the idea that when making a decision <strong>in the present moment, past investments don&#39;t matter.</strong> All that matters is how much you anticipate investing in the future, and whether those investments will pay off.</p><p> Suppose you&#39;ve invested three years working toward an accounting degree in college. But if you could go back, you&#39;d study engineering instead. Should you quit accounting and switch majors or stick it out?</p><p> It&#39;s tempting to analyze this decision by considering it as a whole: “Do I want to study accounting or engineering?” But this isn&#39;t correct. The better question is “Will it be better for me to invest one more year and get an accounting degree, or switch immediately and start four years studying engineering?”</p><p> The previous three years are sunk costs and thus shouldn&#39;t be weighed in your decision about whether to quit. The only thing that matters is future costs and future benefits. Perhaps you decide that having an accounting degree for only one more year of work is worth it, even if you want to study engineering after that. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up3-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17119" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up3-1.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up3-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up3-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> In this case, an analysis of sunk costs discouraged us from quitting early, but it can easily go the other way.</p><p> Suppose you&#39;ve spent three years working on a business idea. Initially, the market looked promising, so you quit your job and spent three years trying to build a company. Now, however, the forecast looks gloomy. You think it will take another three years at least before you can make a go of it—and there are other opportunities that might be better. Should you stay the course, or switch?</p><p> Once again, the past three years don&#39;t matter. Even if those turned out to be a waste of time, they shouldn&#39;t change your decision overall. All that matters is whether the future time (and money) you will invest is better spent continuing or quitting.</p><p> An economic perspective encourages detachment. The question is not “Would I undertake this project if I had to start again?” instead it&#39;s “What&#39;s the value of continuing versus quitting (compared to my alternatives)?”</p><p> Sometimes a half-finished project you&#39;re no longer excited about makes more sense to finish because there&#39;s little work needed to complete it. Sometimes a pursuit you poured your soul into needs to be thrown out because the future investment needed to make it work isn&#39;t worth the payoff.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Don&#39;t rush to act. When&#39;s the best point to re-evaluate your exit?</h2><p> The economic perspective is useful, but it&#39;s only one part of the story. After all, if we could easily make dispassionate decisions about whether to stick it out or give up, deciding what to do—or to quit—wouldn&#39;t be so tricky. The real difficulty is that we alternate between feeling unable to let go of projects and abandoning projects for shiny new pursuits, in neither case explicitly weighing the merits of our choice. Emotion, not reason, looms larger in our decision-making.</p><p> We can&#39;t eliminate our emotions when making decisions. And we wouldn&#39;t want to, even if we could. As neuroscientist Antonio Damasio <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Descartes-Error-Emotion-Reason-Human-ebook/dp/B00AFY2XVK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1644646701&amp;sr=8-1">illustrates</a> , patients with damage to emotional centers of their brain are not hyper-efficient Vulcans, rather they&#39;re hopelessly lost—wasting hours on unimportant tasks because they can&#39;t properly evaluate what matters most.</p><p> But there is a happy medium. One way we can tame some of our worst impulses, without undermining the real value our emotions bring to decision-making, is by creating structures that can influence our decisions.</p><p> One structure I find particularly helpful is to <strong>define your quitting points in advance.</strong> By setting up projects that have well-defined exit ramps, you can ensure you don&#39;t make decisions based on momentary temptations. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17120" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up4-1.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Give-up4-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> For instance, I tend to work on learning projects in focused bursts, rather than making lifelong commitments. Part of the reason for this is that it&#39;s much easier to commit to learning a new language for thirty days than to assume automatically that I&#39;ll want, or be able, to invest in it lifelong. Thirty days is a relatively small commitment, so it&#39;s easier to bolster my commitment even when I&#39;m not feeling like it.</p><p> Another structure that can be helpful is creating an automatic delay or review period for any quitting decision. When you&#39;re convinced you want to give up, set a reminder in one week or one month to re-evaluate. For bigger goals, you might want to set the reminder once you&#39;re past a particularly stressful period—such as deciding whether to quit a job after a big project wraps up, or deciding if you want to switch majors after your final exams—so you&#39;re making the decision from relative neutrality.</p><p> In both of these cases, the length of the pre-commitment period is crucial. Too short, and you&#39;ll allow temporary impulses to drive your decisions. Too long, and you might not be able to endure, defaulting to an emotional response rather than a reasoned one.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. The grass isn&#39;t always greener. What&#39;s the day-to-day reality of the alternative to my current course?</h2><p> Frustration and stress are only one emotional factor. Distractions can be a far bigger issue. How often have you embarked on one goal only to find yourself pulled toward a new one that seems like a better opportunity?</p><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory">Construal-level theory</a> argues that we tend to evaluate decisions using different frames of reference: we view lofty goals idealistically, omitting their complications and details, and we view daily to-do lists pragmatically, with a focus on what&#39;s expedient. But this sets us up for failure, because our current project gets the nitty-gritty treatment, whereas any new pursuit gets viewed through the hazy lens of idealism. Who wouldn&#39;t want to switch under those circumstances?</p><p> One way to overcome this cognitive illusion is to <strong>give yourself a brief, realistic experience of pursuing your alternative</strong> . If you&#39;re thinking about switching majors, take a full class (including homework and exams) from your potential new field. If you&#39;re thinking about switching markets, make a prototype and try to pitch it. Low-key commitments often help us realize that the new pursuit has just as many obstacles and challenges as our current one and can temper the desire to switch.</p><p> If you&#39;re unable to devote time to experience the new pursuit in full detail, it can sometimes be helpful to shift the current project back into the higher construal level to make a fairer comparison. Spend an hour or two journaling about your ultimate goals and values for the project. What originally got you excited about it?</p><p> Finally, a strategy I employ regularly is procrastination. When I get new project ideas, I deliberately put them in a “someday” pile on the back burner. Procrastination is often seen as a vice, but procrastinating on possible distractions means I end up completing more projects. Some of those “someday” projects will make it into reality, but many will be forgotten about entirely as they turned out to be momentary impulses.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Know your values. Which lines won&#39;t you cross?</h2><p> Emotions can sometimes lead us to quit impulsively, but they can also lead us to stay in situations we should walk away from. Sometimes, not quitting is the worse decision, because sticking around in a bad relationship, job or project can waste years of our lives with little to show for our time and effort. Indeed, while quitting prematurely has its costs, sticking out to the bitter end of a failed pursuit is the real tragedy.</p><p> <strong>Make clear, bright-line rules about when you&#39;ll quit, even if you&#39;re tempted to stay.</strong> Here are some conditions where I would advocate quitting:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>The pursuit no longer aligns with your deeply-held values.</strong> For instance, if you start a job with one understanding of the work, but later realize that sticking through will require betraying your internal code of ethics or behaving in a way that&#39;s contrary to your values, quitting is best.</li><li> <strong>The costs of the pursuit clearly exceed its benefits, and there is no clear short-term exit.</strong> I often do push myself to finish projects which (mildly) fail the cost-benefit test if the end of the project is near, because I think a moderate degree of perseverance is worth cultivating. But if the costs are dramatically higher than the benefits, or if there is no clear natural exit for the pursuit, quitting is often necessary.</li><li> <strong>You&#39;re trying to recoup a loss that has already occurred.</strong> One place human nature tends to irrationally discourage quitting is when we&#39;ve lost something and are desperate to “undo” that loss. Gamblers call this going “on tilt,” where a player is no longer making rational analyses because of bets that went bad.</li></ul><p> Every decision is unique, so there&#39;s no single right answer for when to quit. But if you have a process for thinking about those decisions, you&#39;ll be more likely to land on a reasonable choice.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/03/10/when-give-up/">Should You Quit?

Pretty much all our great joys in life (as well as our deepest miseries) are built upon our connection to other people.</p><p> I chose to focus on outreach first because it is a logical antecedent to deeper connection. If you don&#39;t have a lot of close friends or a romantic partner, then there simply might not be a lot of relationships in your life you have the opportunity to deepen. Therefore, meeting new people or strengthening “weak ties” comes first.</p><p> The logical necessity of needing first to meet people before you can be close friends with them isn&#39;t a practical concern in my life now. I&#39;m happily married with two kids. I have good relationships with my family, and I have a number of close friends, both personally and professionally.</p><p> However, I&#39;ve definitely had times where this sequencing would have mattered. I moved around a fair bit in my early twenties, and I&#39;ve had to rebuild a social world for myself from scratch several times. Thus, I know firsthand how important a foundation of outreach is in terms of social success.</p><p> I think it also makes sense to think of outreach as distinct from connection for another reason: the behaviors and skills that support each tend to be different. Deepening connection is largely a matter of spending quality time, being empathetic and being generous, but outreach relies on extraversion, self-confidence and openness to trying new things. From a practical perspective, it makes sense to consider outreach a separate foundation from the work of sustaining your existing close connections.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Reflecting on My Current Outreach</h2><p> My foundation of outreach is weaker than I would like, although part of that is a comparison against previous eras of my life when it was relatively strong.</p><p> In my twenties, I had a social event almost every day. During the early days of my business, I spent a lot of time reaching out to other writers and entrepreneurs. And after moving to a new place, socializing to help me establish new friends (often in a language I didn&#39;t speak very well) was often my main priority.</p><p> Today, however, my level of socializing with people I don&#39;t already know is much lower. A big part of that is simply the current phase of my life. With two small kids at home, I have less time, and frankly less motivation, to seek out new friends. I often feel like I don&#39;t have enough time to maintain a lot of the friendships I already have, never mind doing social activities with the express purpose of meeting new people.</p><p> However, it&#39;s too easy to dismiss the need for outreach out of simple busyness. The same argument could apply to lots of other foundations. I don&#39;t play sports and the need to maintain a certain physique is less prominent when you&#39;re a busy parent—but that doesn&#39;t make fitness unimportant as you get older. Similarly, I think a total neglect of outreach could easily lead to a situation where, emerging from the isolated cocoon of early parenthood, I find myself with fewer friends and activities than I would like. An analogy might be a person who was an athlete in college, didn&#39;t notice they were getting out of shape in their thirties and forties, and find they now have preventable health problems in old age. Better to fix a foundation <em>before</em> the weaknesses cause problems.</p><p> Still, given my life constraints and my currently ample supply of friends and family, I want to strike the right balance between an appropriate amount of time spent on outreach and maintaining my existing relationships and commitments.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Keystone Habit: Weekly Social Activity</h2><p> Given the need for some amount of outreach, and my existing commitments, I think aiming for a habit of attending a social activity roughly once-per-week is probably ideal. Unlike my fitness habit, in which I aim for near total consistency, given the irregular nature of social events, I&#39;m less concerned about the strictness of this habit. I think if I hit the ~1x/week average, that would be good.</p><p> My criteria for a social activity is that there is an opportunity to meet new people. This could be Meetups, classes or group activities where I don&#39;t know anyone already. Or it could be activities I attend with my existing friends where I don&#39;t already know all the people in attendance.</p><p> Once per week sounds like a pretty good minimal commitment. It&#39;s hard to imagine a person for whom one outing weekly would be excessive, but I can definitely consider some people for whom a single weekly social activity would be too little. It definitely would have been too little when I was new to a city, was single, was trying to get a foothold professionally or was simply lacking friends in my life. So I don&#39;t think this is a universal benchmark, although it might function as a reasonable minimum threshold for most people.</p><p> To reach this goal, I&#39;m doing what I&#39;ve always done: finding Meetups based on some of my interests, asking friends for activities they&#39;re part of, and keeping my eyes open for opportunities. Since I&#39;ve been running more lately, I may drop in on a running club or two and kill two birds with one stone by getting my daily exercise in, too.</p><p> I&#39;m also keen to restart some language practice. This was something I enjoyed pre-kids, but with the pandemic cancelling all in-person meetings and the increased demands of having two babies, I dropped it almost entirely. So I&#39;ll keep an eye on this as well.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Other Outreach Metrics</h2><p> I&#39;m prioritizing simply attending some social events on a roughly weekly basis for my outreach activity. This is partly because my needs in this foundation are pretty non-specific. As mentioned, I&#39;m happily married, so the dating angle that motivates a lot of social activity isn&#39;t there for me.</p><p> Similarly, while I can always do better in professional networking, this isn&#39;t an area I&#39;m prioritizing either. I&#39;m always happy to meet people professionally, but I feel like I get enough opportunities organically at this point in my career that this doesn&#39;t require a lot of extra work.</p><p> However, in addition to the weekly habit of socializing, I&#39;d like to be more organized about keeping up and scheduling time with more distant friends. I&#39;m not naturally good at this, and not being on social media makes it worse. While setting up CRM software for friends seems a little dehumanizing, I think I do need some system of reminders to at least check-in on those people so I don&#39;t lose touch.</p><p> I haven&#39;t decided exactly what system I want to use. In the past, I&#39;ve experimented with recurring reminders and spreadsheets to try to solve this problem, but I always bristled a bit at their formality. Instead, I might try a more regular practice of checking in on people once a quarter or year to make up for my lack of awareness of people&#39;s updates on social media.</p><p> As always, toward the end of the month, I&#39;ll share some insights from my reading for the month as well as how my planned habit changes went.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/03/04/outreach-day-one/">Outreach – Day One</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/03/04/outreach-day-one/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reflections on a Month for Reading</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/25/reflections-on-a-month-for-reading/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/25/reflections-on-a-month-for-reading/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:23:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=17066 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;m wrapping up this month&#39;s focus, reading, in my year-long Foundations project.

This is largely an occupational side-effect, but my reading volume isn&#39;t something that concerns me. </p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Foundations Conversation Month 5 Update - Reading" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3WZCQmljhc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p> Instead, my goals for the month were twofold:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>To read, however briefly, right before bed</strong> . I felt like this habit would facilitate sleeping well, in addition to injecting another regular reading slot into my life.</li><li> <strong>To expand the breadth of books I read</strong> . I wanted to spend more time reading literature, history and topics not directly related to my writing. (Though I admit such breadth will probably not be sustained outside of this initial month.)</li></ol><p> For both goals, I was successful:</p><p> I managed to read every night before falling asleep, although on nights spent with company, my wife and I went to bed later, and I kept this reading brief. I will strive to continue this habit, especially when I approach the month when my project focuses on sleep itself. Books beat screens for improving sleep quality.</p><p> In terms of breadth, I was also successful. In particular, I focused on two books I have wanted to read that kept getting pushed out of my queue by more “important” books: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-667x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17070" style="width:107px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-195x300.jpg 195w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/811iBn28JdL._SL1500_.jpg 977w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17071" style="width:164px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_.jpg 1000w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/619AGDYz4vL._SL1000_-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong><em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> .</strong> This is my all-time favorite novel. I&#39;ve read it at least three times, and last summer I started listening to it as an audiobook in French. Given this month&#39;s focus, I restarted where I left off and have nearly reach the end.</li><li> <strong><em>Journey to the West</em> .</strong> This Chinese classic has been sitting on my shelf since my first trip to China, but the Chinese text was too difficult for me. I&#39;ve surrendered a couple times when attempting to read it in the original Chinese, only making it through a few pages at a time. Now, I&#39;ve decided to read it in English first, following Anthony Yu&#39;s unabridged translation.</li></ol><p> Both books are excellent, but they&#39;re hardly quick reads. The unabridged audiobook for <em>Monte Cristo</em> is nearly 50 hours long, and Yu&#39;s translation runs nearly 2000 pages. Thus, in an ironic twist, the month focused on reading is probably the one in which I finished the fewest total books!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Reading about Reading: Notes on Five Books</h2><p> In addition to my literary excursions, I read five books about reading for this month&#39;s research, two of which were re-reads. This is a lot less than I normally read for <a href="https://join.ingeniumcourses.com/foundations/">Foundations</a> each month. Part of this was owing to the amount of time I took to read longer books that were off-topic, as mentioned earlier. But a bigger part was simply that I have already read a ton of books on this topic as part of researching <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/getbetter/">my latest book</a> , so I didn&#39;t feel compelled to research the topic as aggressively as I do the subjects that are new to me.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 1-Minute Summary of What I Learned</h2><p> First, some quick takeaways from this month&#39;s research:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li> <strong>Reading relies on brain mechanisms that evolved to do different jobs</strong> , that are recycled to be applied to the evolutionarily-recent task of reading.</li><li> <strong>Despite differences in scripts, reading in Chinese, English and Italian all use basically the same brain circuitry</strong> .</li><li> <strong>Reading speed is mechanically and psychologically limited</strong> . Speed reading doesn&#39;t work, and the upper limit on reading (without skimming or skipping stuff) is probably around 500 words per minute for most people.</li><li> <strong>Knowledge is the biggest driver of comprehension and memory</strong> . The more you know the more you&#39;ll remember from what you read. Ultimately this, not speed, is probably the biggest factor separating people who easily read dozens of books in a month and those who find one or two to be arduous.</li><li> <strong>Reading is a virtuous cycle</strong> . In keeping with my fourth point, if you read more, you know more, which makes further reading easier and more enjoyable. Reading well comes from reading lots.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Notes on Five Books</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Mind-Cognitive-Approach-Understanding/dp/1119301378">The Reading Mind</a> by Daniel Willingham </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17072" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/81VSttzZKhL._SL1500_.jpg 994w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this when it came out. Now, having done a lot more background research on reading, I can appreciate just how good a job Willingham does in covering the basic cognitive science of reading.</p><p> Willingham carefully articulates the current standard model for how reading works, from moving your eyes, to decoding letters on the page, to the dual routes of sounding out words while accessing irregular ones through a mental lexicon, assembling words into propositions, determining what a book says and, finally, what it actually means. Along the way, he dispels many myths and misconceptions about this process held by educators and readers alike.</p><p> My favorite part of this book was Willingham&#39;s discussion of how limited our field of vision is—and how unaware we are of this. Researchers using eye-tracking software transformed a page of text to replace every character outside a narrow range of vision with the letter “X”, quickly updating the display every time a person&#39;s eye moved. Not only did this change have no effect on reading speed—subjects didn&#39;t even realize there was anything strange about the text!</p><p> Truly, the things most familiar to us contain some of the greatest surprises.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095/">How to Read a Book</a> by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="659" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17073" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-659x1024.jpg 659w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-193x300.jpg 193w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_-768x1193.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/91Z6ApocmwL._SL1500_.jpg 966w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></figure></div><p> This classic has long been recommended to me, but it never made its way out of my book queue. I figured this month was as good a time as any to actually finish it.</p><p> The book is well-argued. It articulates a demanding form of “analytical” reading to be applied to the close reading of particular books. The authors argue from the point of view of a reader determining, solely from his or her own efforts and without relying on external commentary, what a book means.</p><p> On the one hand, it&#39;s hard to fault much of the advice given in the book, which I found beneficial. And it certainly helped me reflect on my own research process which mirrors the “syntopical” reading they discuss near the end.</p><p> And yet, through my research over the past few years, I&#39;ve become more inclined to believe in the “knowledge-centric” view of reading competency rather than the “skills-based” view, especially in light of educational evidence that excessive reliance on skills training has pretty sharp diminishing returns and that what students generally need most is more knowledge.</p><p> Still, I think Adler and Van Doren&#39;s book is a classic for a reason, and it outlines a useful strategy for tackling books that might otherwise seem too daunting even to consider.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Paper-Evidence-based-Healthcare/dp/111948474X/">How to Read a Paper</a> by Trisha Greenhalgh </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-663x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17074" style="width:150px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-194x300.jpg 194w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_-768x1186.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61C33r6WoKL._SL1500_.jpg 971w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></figure></div><p> I first read this when embarking on my research project for my first book, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . While aimed at medical practitioners, the advice in this book is useful to anyone who wants to make sense of, or apply recommendations from, quantitative research.</p><p> There&#39;s a danger in becoming halfway educated on a topic and, as someone who is halfway educated about many things, I&#39;m well aware of the risks. It&#39;s all too easy to see a study cited or read a single book and feel like that&#39;s the end of the story on a contentious topic. It rarely is.</p><p> Still, I think we live in a media ecosystem which increasingly requires us to understand scientific work in order to evaluate claims in health, education, politics and beyond. In short, we&#39;re all unavoidably doing the kind of amateur research that often backfires into overconfidence in shoddy opinions.</p><p> From this perspective, I think Greenhalgh&#39;s book should be mandatory reading for everyone. She outlines the right way to think about published research. As Richard Feynman once remarked, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” Knowing how to read a paper cannot substitute for years of study, but perhaps it can help you avoid fooling yourself.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Brain-New-Science-Read/dp/0143118056/">Reading in the Brain</a> by Stanislas Dehaene </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="668" height="1024" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17076" style="width:157px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-668x1024.jpg 668w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_-768x1178.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/714ZJg2HzTL._SL1500_.jpg 978w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></figure></div><p> A good complement to Willingham&#39;s <em>The Reading Mind</em> , this book, authored by one of the leading neuroscientists in his field, covers the neuroscientific perspective on reading.</p><p> It was from this book I learned the surprising fact that nearly all readers, in all languages, read in nearly the same way.

And what is the point of reading great literature? To be changed by it. To have the themes and descriptions give you tools for deciding how to live. This sort of explanation would have caused me to raise my eyebrows not too long ago. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to read philosophy, which directly tackles such questions, rather than an entertaining work that merely reaches them obliquely? The idea that someone could read <em>The Iliad</em> and derive from it a way of life borders upon the absurd. (The epic, you shall recall, begins with Achilles&#39; temper tantrum over the forfeiture of his war-won sex slave.)</p><p> Yet, I think Edmundson did a good job arguing his point. Stories are felt in ways that arguments are not. Reading <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> in my youth did more to shape my feelings about the idea of committing to a long and patient plan than any rational analysis about such an approach did.</p><p> Therefore, while I think direct instruction and books that plainly tackle one&#39;s questions are the best way to answer them, I think good literature and philosophy can help you ask better questions of your life in the first place. For that, they deserve a place in your library for more than mere entertainment.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> That&#39;s it for this month.

This is because each expert has a different subset of all available knowledge on a topic, so the average view is a better “best guess” than any individual&#39;s opinion.</li><li> The majority expert opinion may be wrong. But contrarian opinions are even more likely to be wrong. The value of this perspective is probabilistic: expert consensus will fail sometimes, but it fails less often than the contrarian alternative. It is therefore a strong default presumption to hold. </li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17043" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> I forget exactly where I first heard this argument, but I find the logic difficult to reject. Experts are more accurate than non-experts. The expert consensus<span id='easy-footnote-6-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-17038' title="Or, if no consensus exists, then the viewpoint which would win a plurality of votes, were there to be an election."><sup>6</sup></a></span> is more accurate than any particular expert.</p><p> Despite the logic of this argument, the advice simply to believe the dominant scientific viewpoint on an issue has a lot of dissenters. Indeed, even though we could easily recognize its accuracy, if a viewpoint doesn&#39;t “feel” right, isn&#39;t it kind of brainless to just accept whatever some group of experts tells us to think? Shouldn&#39;t you make up your own mind and come to your own conclusions?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Objections to Simply Trusting Expertise</h2><p> There are many objections to the anti-contrarian epistemology I&#39;m supporting here, and I&#39;d like to review a few of them. While I do think some of these arguments can be legitimate, they need be invoked carefully. Successful contrarianism is like successful gambling—possible in theory, but it frequently leads to losing your shirt.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. “Experts ignore X.”</h3><p> The most common cry of the skeptic is that the experts ignore valuable evidence. In this view, because the expert opinion fails to sample some part of the useful knowledge needed to form an opinion, the conclusions aren&#39;t to be trusted. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17044" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> This is undoubtedly true, but I would argue it is a virtue rather than a vice. A lot of seeming evidence isn&#39;t reliable for forming conclusions, and simpler theories often lead to better explanations than ones that try to account for everything.</p><p> A physicist may assume an object is a perfectly rigid cube lying on a frictionless plane. A nutritionist may simplify foods into a collection of chemicals. An economist may assume people behave as rational utility-maximizing agents.</p><p> The omissions made by these models are not haphazard—experts themselves debate about which factors are important. Models and theories must necessarily be simpler than reality; a map as large as the territory it describes would be useless.</p><p> Claiming that a body of expertise is wrong because it systematically ignores some factor is simply a restatement of the contrarian claim that “factor X is important, but mainstream expert opinion says it isn&#39;t.” In other words, this argument doesn&#39;t work on its own. You&#39;d need an additional explanation for <em>why</em> experts ignore X, even though it is evidently important.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. “Experts are biased.”</h3><p> Although my rationale for believing experts is based on the idea that experts are simply smart people who know a lot about a topic, that isn&#39;t quite accurate. In reality, experts are social groups that carefully draw boundaries between members and non-members.</p><p> This social reality influences expertise, and anyone who has spent time with experts can attest to how much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_Life">social factors influence which beliefs take root</a> in expert communities.</p><p> If researchers are ideologically committed to a particular position, or they find certain conclusions of their research unpalatable for non-epistemic reasons, or even if they are disproportionately drawn from a group that is likely to hold strong prior beliefs, these can all be reasons to question expert conclusions. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17051" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion4-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> As an example, I find it difficult to wholeheartedly accept a lot of the science done by meditation or psychedelic researchers. These fields have a selection effect where many of the researchers begin with strong beliefs that those things ought to work, so there&#39;s a greater chance of finding false positive effects for the usual reasons science can go wrong.<span id='easy-footnote-7-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-17038' title="The opposite is also true: If people who have an ideological incentive to find a particular answer &lt;em>;struggle&lt;/em>; to find it, that’s probably strong evidence for a null conclusion. This was my takeaway on the research on cognitive training, which has had disappointing results despite being researched by many hopeful enthusiasts."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p> However, while bias is real and potentially a ground for legitimate contrarianism, we must also turn the mirror on ourselves. We, too, have biases that predispose us to be favorable to some perspectives rather than others. Casually discarding expert opinion because of bias is the pot calling the kettle black. If you&#39;re going to dismiss the majority opinion of a field because of bias, you need strong evidence that you yourself are more likely to be impartial—a high bar that few contrarians can surmount.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. “Those experts are fake.”</h3><p> Perhaps the biggest indictment of a field is simply to decry that the brand of expertise they practice is fake. If the knowledge the field has amassed is utter garbage, then there&#39;s no real reason for believing any of the claims it makes.</p><p> This claim is easiest to see with the benefit of hindsight. <em>Of course</em> scholastics who believed in Aristotle&#39;s four-elements theory of physics were fake. <em>Of course</em> doctors who used blood letting and leeches as cure-alls were fake. <em>Of course</em> alchemists, astrologers and fortune-tellers are fake. We see those fields, and the knowledge they accumulated, as largely worthless enterprises today—the average person would have been better off staying at home than visiting a doctor who would likely bleed them to death for a minor ailment. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17046" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion5-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> Of course, the idea that economics, theoretical physics, finance, nutrition, cognitive science or social psychology are fake fields with fake expertise is popular among contrarians of all stripes. After all, if you can reject the legitimacy of experts, you can discount their consensus opinions wholesale.</p><p> I&#39;m sympathetic to this claim. Like most people, I have my preferences for evidence and my hierarchy of fields I&#39;m willing to believe more strongly—and those I&#39;m more likely to roll my eyes at.</p><p> But, the argument for believing specific <em>claims</em> of expert opinion extends to believing in specific <em>fields</em> of expertise. Intellectual life doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. Different groups of experts all vie for supremacy on most topics—there are many questions that are simultaneously tackled by social psychologists, economists, anthropologists and humanities scholars. If an intellectual argument clearly “wins” in the court of opinion among intelligent observers, then that field gets a larger share of the intellectual marketplace and the less-successful intellectual group withers.</p><p> Indeed, the reason it&#39;s easier to point to past groups of experts as being clearly fake is because their paradigms did not survive the intellectual evolutionary process. Alchemy was outcompeted by chemistry. Aristotle&#39;s theory was outcompeted by Newton&#39;s. Modern evidence-based medicine outcompeted bloodletting and folk remedies.</p><p> In short, the rationale for accepting the legitimacy of a field are the same as the rationales for accepting a specific claim made within a field: If there were a better, more intellectually satisfying approach, the likelihood is that the better approach would dominate the current paradigm—from another community of experts if not from within.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. “Trusting experts is intellectually lazy. You should review the evidence and come to your own conclusions.”</h3><p> A final objection doesn&#39;t rest on the weakness of expert opinion, rather on the supposed intellectual vice that simply trusting experts creates. In this view, being the kind of person who follows along with the mainstream consensus is cowardly and lazy: you should bravely think for yourself—even if you sometimes get the wrong answer.</p><p> But this, to me, is a fundamental misconception. Trusting expertise is not an intellectually simple task. It takes enormous work to bring your worldview even partly in line with what experts think. Deep understanding requires you to review much of the knowledge that experts possess—hardly a task for the intellectually lazy. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17047" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion6-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> Instead, it&#39;s typically the reflexive contrarians who are intellectually lazy. They would prefer to read one flashy book that supports a worldview they are already predisposed to believe rather than wade through multiple dense textbooks that slowly build the consensus perspective.</p><p> Simply parroting the conclusions of experts is not enough. To really understand an expert conclusion, you need to develop for yourself the mental models used to generate it. That&#39;s hard work. It&#39;s why getting an advanced degree in a field takes so long—mastering the tools and models needed to accurately simulate the expert opinion in a wide range of scenarios within a single field takes years, and that must happen before the student can do their own meaningful work in that field.</p><p> Truly smart contrarianism not only has to articulate an opposing view, but provide a deep explanation for why that viewpoint is not widely accepted by other smart people with similar knowledge. Few experts in a given field ever reach this position, never mind casual readers commenting on a topic outside of their specialty.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Final, Moderating Factors</h2><p> My original advice was:</p><p> <strong>If you want to have more true beliefs, you should simply believe the experts who study the topic, most of the time.</strong></p><p> I would add a few moderating factors to that generalization:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Experts can tell you what to believe—not how strongly to believe it.</h3><p> The quality of evidence used to form expert beliefs varies widely. Despite this, experts, on the whole, are highly confident of their own opinions. Since making decisions in life depends on not only what the “best guess” beliefs are, but how likely they are to be correct, this lack of calibration is a problem for my simple model of trusting experts. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17048" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion7-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> I have much more faith in basic physics than basic nutrition, for instance. I would be extremely surprised if the principles of quantum mechanics turned out to be wrong, but it wouldn&#39;t shock me if nutritional researchers flip-flopped on the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/">link between saturated fat and heart disease</a> .</p><p> This lack of confidence calibration means that while it&#39;s not usually justified to say, “the experts are all wrong, you should believe X instead,” it&#39;s not always incorrect to say, “the experts are wrong, you shouldn&#39;t have <em>any</em> opinion on X.” Skepticism of the expert view in shaky fields is consistent with the position I&#39;m advocating for, even if true skepticism (rather than ardent belief in even more dubious propositions) is quite rare.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. If your goal isn&#39;t to maximize true beliefs, contrarianism can be justified.</h3><p> Somewhat ironically, the individual experts aren&#39;t necessarily incentivized to maximize the truth value of their beliefs. Expert consensus is a kind of smudgy, bland version of a particular worldview; it&#39;s what&#39;s left after averaging out of all sorts of unique or unusual perspectives. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17049" style="width:450px" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8.jpg 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Expert-opinion8-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div><p> In contrast, a scientist or pundit aims not just to be right about the stuff everyone already agrees on, but to be <em>surprisingly</em> correct—to hold a belief that later turns out to be perceived as more plausible, thus changing the consensus viewpoint.</p><p> Indeed, this may even be a good thing. An intellectual environment where all experts followed my “just trust the experts” maxim would result in excessive conformity of opinion, making bias more likely. We should want to live in a world where experts don&#39;t agree, and instead debate each other, as this raises the average quality of their opinions.<span id='easy-footnote-8-17038' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-17038' title="There is certainly a tension here with my advice. I recognize the value of believing experts, and I also recognize that if this is all I do, my work will probably fail to have much lasting intellectual value. I need to adopt at least a mild degree of contrarianism in my work, or I’ll risk being irrelevant."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p><p> An analogy is investing. The average investor is better off putting their money in a low-cost index fund rather than picking stocks. Most investors (including professionals) fail to beat the market consistently. And yet, we do want at least some amount of (mostly deluded) contrarians trying to actively beat the market, since it is this very activity that determines values in the market.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Final Thoughts</h2><p> While I first heard this argument for believing expertise ages ago, I don&#39;t think its logic alone is what made me attempt to follow it more rigorously in my life.</p><p> Instead, it&#39;s the experience of having been persuaded by a contrarian expert, being fully convinced and, years later, being dissuaded from those original views as I encountered more evidence. And unlike the boy who touched the fire, it took being burned more than a few times before I developed the reflex.</p><p> While I doubt this argument will bring any dyed-in-the-wool contrarians or conspiracy theorists to my worldview, I do hope it will nudge a few people into giving more weight to the dominant expert perspective, and a bit less weight to the voices of persuasive-sounding contrarians.</p><p> Because, ultimately, having true beliefs does matter. Your beliefs inform how you invest, eat, build your career, raise your kids and take care of your health. And if your fundamental worldview isn&#39;t optimized for gathering true beliefs, you&#39;re bound to make mistakes.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/">Just Trust the Experts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/02/18/trust-the-experts/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
